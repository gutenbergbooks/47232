    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T IS needless to
      eulogize the Rose. Poets from Anacreon and Sappho, and earlier than they,
      down to our own times, have sung its praises; and yet the rose of Grecian
      and of Persian song, the rose of troubadours and minstrels, had no
      beauties so resplendent as those with which its offspring of the present
      day embellish our gardens. The "thirty sorts of rose," of which John
      Parkinson speaks in 1629, have multiplied to thousands. New races have
      been introduced from China, Persia, Hindostan, and our own country; and
      these, amalgamated with the older families by the art of the hybridist,
      have produced still other forms of surpassing variety and beauty. This
      multiplication and improvement are still in progress. The last two or
      three years have been prolific beyond precedent in new roses; and, with
      all regard for old favorites, it cannot be denied, that, while a few of
      the roses of our forefathers still hold their ground, the greater part are
      cast into the shade by the brilliant products of this generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the production of new roses, France takes the lead. A host of
      cultivators great and small&mdash;Laffay, Vibert, Verdier, Margottin,
      Trouillard, Portemer, and numberless others&mdash;have devoted themselves
      to the pleasant art of intermarrying the various families and individual
      varieties of the rose, and raising from them seedlings whose numbers every
      year may be counted by hundreds of thousands. Of these, a very few only
      are held worthy of preservation; and all the rest are consigned to the
      rubbish heap. The English, too, have of late done much in raising new
      varieties; though their climate is less favorable than that of France, and
      their cultivators less active and zealous in the work. Some excellent
      roses, too, have been produced in America. Our climate is very favorable
      to the raising of seedlings, and far more might easily be accomplished
      here.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France and England, the present rage for roses is intense. It is
      stimulated by exhibitions, where nurserymen, gardeners, landed gentlemen,
      and reverend clergymen of the Established Church, meet in friendly
      competition for the prize. While the French excel all others in the
      production of new varieties, the English are unsurpassed in the
      cultivation of varieties already known; and nothing can exceed the beauty
      and perfection of some of the specimens exhibited at their innumerable
      rose-shows. If the severity of our climate has its disadvantages, the
      clearness of our air and the warmth of our summer sun more than
      counterbalance them; and it is certain that roses can be raised here in as
      high perfection, to say the very least, as in any part of Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of this book is to convey information. The earlier portion will
      describe the various processes of culture, training, and propagation, both
      in the open ground and in pots; and this will be followed by an account of
      the various families and groups of the rose, with descriptions of the best
      varieties belonging to each. A descriptive list will be added of all the
      varieties, both of old roses and those most recently introduced, which are
      held in esteem by the experienced cultivators of the present day. The
      chapter relating to the classification of roses, their family relations,
      and the manner in which new races have arisen by combinations of two or
      more old ones, was suggested by the difficulties of the writer himself at
      an early period of his rose studies. The want of such explanations, in
      previous treatises, has left their readers in a state of lamentable
      perplexity on a subject which might easily have been made sufficiently
      clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Books on the rose, written for the climates of France or England, will, in
      general, greatly mislead the cultivators here. Extracts will, however, be
      given from the writings of the best foreign cultivators, in cases where
      experience has shown that their directions are applicable to the climate
      of the Northern and Middle States. The writer having been for many years a
      cultivator of the rose, and having carefully put in practice the methods
      found successful abroad, is enabled to judge with some confidence of the
      extent to which they are applicable here, and to point out exceptions and
      modifications demanded by the nature of our climate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among English writers on the rose, the best are Paul, Rivers, and more
      recently Cranston, together with the vivacious Mr. Radclyffe, a clergyman,
      a horticulturist, an excellent amateur of the rose, and a very amusing
      contributor to the "Florist." In France, Deslongchamps and several able
      contributors to the "Revue Horticole" are the most prominent. From these
      sources the writer of this book drew the instructions and hints which at
      first formed the basis of his practice; but he soon found that he must
      greatly modify it in accordance with American necessities. There was much
      to be added, much to be discarded, and much to be changed; and the results
      to which he arrived are given, as compactly as possible, in the following
      pages.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE ROSE requires
      high culture. This belle of the parterre, this "queen of flowers," is a
      lover of rich fare, and refuses to put forth all her beauties on a meagre
      diet. Roses, indeed, will grow and bloom in any soil; but deficient
      nourishment will reduce the size of the flowers, and impair the perfection
      of their form. Of all soils, one of a sandy or gravelly nature is the
      worst; while, on the other hand, a wet and dense clay is scarcely better.
      A rich, strong, and somewhat heavy garden loam, abundantly manured, is the
      soil best adapted to all the strong-growing roses; while those of more
      delicate growth prefer one pro-portionably lighter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet roses may be grown to perfection in any soil, if the needful pains are
      taken. We will suppose an extreme case: The grower wishes to plant a bed
      of roses on a spot where the soil is very poor and sandy. Let him mark out
      his bed, dig the soil to the depth of eighteen inches? throw out the worst
      portion of it, and substitute in its place a quantity of strong, heavy
      loam: rotted sods, if they can be had, will be an excellent addition; and
      so, also, will decayed leaves. Then add a liberal dressing of old stable
      manure: that taken from a last year's hot-bod will do admirably. It is
      scarcely possible to enrich too highly. One-fourth manure to three-fourths
      soil is not an excessive proportion. Now incorporate the whole thoroughly
      with a spade, level the top, and your bed is ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: we will suppose a case, equally bad, but of the opposite character.
      Here the soil is very wet, cold, and heavy. The first step is to drain it.
      This may be done thoroughly with tiles, after the approved methods; or, if
      this is too troublesome or expensive, simpler means may be used, which
      will, in most situations, prove as effectual. Dig a hole about five feet
      deep and four feet wide at the lower side of your intended bed of roses:
      in this hole place an inverted barrel, with the head knocked out; or, what
      is better, an old oil cask. In the latter case, a hole should be bored in
      it, near the top, to permit the air to escape. Fill the space around the
      cask or barrel with stones, and then cover the whole with earth. If your
      bed is of considerable extent, a drain, laid in stone or tile, should be
      made under or beside the bed, at the depth of three feet, and so
      constructed as to lead to the sunken barrel. Throw out, if necessary, a
      portion of the worst soil of the bed, substituting light loam, rotted
      leaves, and coarse gritty sand. Then add an abundance of old stable
      manure, as in the former case.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great majority of gardens, however, such pains are superfluous. Any
      good garden soil, deeply dug, and thoroughly enriched, will grow roses in
      perfection. Neither manure nor the spade should be spared. Three
      conditions are indispensable,&mdash;sun, air, and exemption from the
      invasion of the roots of young growing trees. These last are insidious
      plunderers and thieves, which invade the soil, and rob its lawful
      occupants of the stores of nutriment provided for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rose planted on the shady side of a grove of elm or maple trees is in
      one of the worst possible of situations. If, however, the situation is in
      other respects good, the evil of the invading roots may be cured for a
      time by digging a trench, three feet deep, between the trees and the bed
      of roses; thus cutting off the intruders. The trench may then be filled up
      immediately; but, if the trees are vigorous, it must be dug over again the
      following year. It is much better to choose, at the outset, an airy, sunny
      situation, at a reasonable distance from growing trees; but, at the same
      time, a spot exposed to violent winds should be avoided, as they are very
      injurious and exhausting.

      Roses may be planted either in spring or in autumn. In the Northern
      States, the severity of the winter demands some protection, when planted
      in autumn, for all except the old, hardy varieties. Plant as early as
      possible, that the roots may take some hold on the soil before winter
      closes. October, for this reason, is better than November. The best
      protection is earth heaped around the stem to the height of from six
      inches to a foot. Pine, cedar, or spruce boughs are also excellent. When
      earth alone is used, the top of the rose is often frost-killed; but this
      is usually of no consequence, the growth and bloom being only more
      vigorous for this natural pruning. Dry leaves heaped among or around the
      roses, and kept down by sticks or pieces of board, or by earth thrown on
      them, are also good protectors. In spring, plant as early as the soil is
      in working order; that is to say, as soon as it is dry enough not to
      adhere in lumps to the spade.
    </p>
    <p>
      In planting, prune back the straggling roots with a sharp knife, but save
      as many of the small fibres as possible. If you plant in spring, prune
      back the stem at least half way to the ground; but, if you plant in
      autumn, by all means defer this operation till the winter is over. The
      ground around autumn-planted roses should be trodden down in the spring,
      since the plant will have been somewhat loosened in its place by the
      effect of frost; but this treading must not take place until the soil has
      become free from excessive moisture. Budded roses require a peculiar
      treatment in planting, which we shall describe when we come to speak of
      them.

    <p>
      Next to soil and situation, pruning is the most important point of
      attention to the rose-grower. Long treatises have been written on it,
      describing in detail different modes applicable to different classes of
      roses, and confusing the amateur by a multitude of perplexing particulars.
    </p>
    <p>
      One principle will cover most of the ground: <i>Weaklygrowing roses should
      be severely pruned: those of vigorous growth should be pruned but little</i>.
      Or, to speak more precisely, <i>roses should be pruned in inverse
      proportion to the vigor of their growth.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Much, however, depends on the object at which the grower aims. If he
      wishes for a profusion of bloom, without regard to the size and perfection
      of individual flowers, then comparatively little pruning is required. If,
      on the other hand, he wishes for blooms of the greatest size and
      perfection, without regard to number, he will prune more closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pruning of any tree or shrub at a time when vegetation is dormant acts
      as a stimulus to its vital powers. Hence, when it is naturally vigorous,
      it is urged by close pruning to such a degree of growth, that it has no
      leisure to bear flowers, developing instead a profusion of leaves and
      branches. The few flowers which it may produce under such circumstances,
      will, however, be unusually large.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most vigorous growers among roses are the climbers, such as the
      "Boursaults" and the "Prairies."
    </p>
    <p>
      These require very little pruning: first, because of their vigor; and,
      secondly, because quantity rather than quality of bloom is asked of them.
      The old and dry wood should be cut wholly away, leaving the strong young
      growth to take its place, with no other pruning than a clipping-off of the
      ends of side-shoots, and a thinning-out of crowded or misshapen branches.
      In all roses, it is the young, well-ripened wood that bears the finest
      flowers. Old enfeebled wood, or unripe, soft, and defective young wood,
      should always be removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next in vigor to the climbers are some of the groups of hardy June roses;
      such, for example, as those called the Hybrid China roses. These are
      frequently grown on posts or pillars; in which case they require a special
      treatment, to be indicated hereafter. We are now supposing them to be
      grown as bushes in the garden or on the lawn. Cut out the old wood, and
      the weak, unripe, and sickly shoots, as well as those which interfere with
      others; then shorten the remaining stems one-third, and cut back the
      side-shoots to three or four buds. This is on the supposition that a full
      mass of bloom is required, without much regard to the development of
      individual flowers. If quality rather than quantity of bloom is the
      desideratum, the pruning both of the main stems and of the side-shoots
      must be considerably shorter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roses of more moderate growth, including the greater part of the June,
      Moss, Hybrid Perpetual, and Bourbon roses, require a proportionally closer
      pruning. The stems may be cut down to half their length, and the
      side-shoots shortened to two buds. All the weak-growing roses, of whatever
      class, may be pruned with advantage even more closely than this. Some of
      the weak-growing Hybrid Perpetuals grow and bloom best when shortened to
      within four or five buds of the earth. The stronggrowing kinds, on the
      contrary, if pruned thus severely, would grow with great vigor, but give
      very few flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The objects of pruning are threefold: first, to invigorate the plant;
      secondly, to improve its flowers; and, thirdly, to give it shape and
      proportion. This last object should always be kept in view by the
      operator. No two stems should be allowed to crowd each other. A mass of
      matted foliage is both injurious and unsightly. Sun and air should have
      access to every part of the plant. Six or seven stems are the utmost that
      should be allowed to remain, even on old established bushes; and these, as
      before mentioned, should be strong and well ripened, and should also be
      disposed in such a manner, that, when the buds have grown into shoots and
      leaves, the bush will have a symmetrical form. In young bushes, three, or
      even two, good stems are sufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pruning in summer, when the plant is in active growth, has an effect
      contrary to that of pruning when it is in a dormant state. Far from
      increasing its vigor, it weakens it, by depriving it of a portion of its
      leaves, which are at once its stomach and its lungs. Only two kinds of
      summer pruning can be recommended. The first consists in the removal of
      small branches which crowd their neighbors, and interfere with them: the
      second is confined to the various classes of Perpetual roses, and consists
      merely in cutting off the faded flowers, together with the shoots on which
      they grow, to within three or four buds of the main stem. This greatly
      favors their tendency to bloom again later in the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      When old wood is cut away, it should be done cleanly, without leaving a
      protruding stump. A small saw will sometimes be required for this purpose;
      though in most cases a knife, or, what is more convenient, a pair of sharp
      pruning-shears, will be all that the operator requires.

      When roses are trained to cover walls, trellises, arches, or pillars, the
      main stems are encouraged to a strong growth. These form the permanent
      wood; while the side-shoots, more or less pruned back, furnish the
      flowers. For arbors, walls, or very tall pillars, the strongest growers
      are most suitable, such as the Prairie, Boursault, and Ayrshire roses.
      Enrich the soil strongly, and dig deep and widely. Choose a healthy young
      rose, and, in planting, cut off all the stems close to the earth. During
      the season, it will make a number of strong young shoots. In the following
      spring cut out half of them, leaving the strongest, which are to be
      secured against the wall, or over the arbor, diverging like a fan or
      otherwise, as fancy may suggest. The subsequent pruning is designed
      chiefly to regulate the growth of the rose, encouraging the progress of
      the long leading shoots until they have reached the required height, and
      removing side-shoots where they are too thick. Where a vacant space
      occurs, a strong neighboring shoot may be pruned back in spring to a
      single eye. This will stimulate it to a vigorous growth, producing a stem
      which will serve to fill the gap. Of the young shoots, which, more or
      less, will rise every season from the root, the greater part should be cut
      away, reserving two or three to take the place of the old original stems
      when these become weak by age. When these climbing roses are used for
      pillars, they may either be trained vertically, or wound in a spiral form
      around the supporting column.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roses of more moderate growth are often trained to poles or small pillars
      from six to twelve feet high. Some of the Hybrid China roses are, as
      before mentioned, well adapted to this use; and even some of the most
      vigorous Moss roses, such as <i>Princess Adelaide</i>, may be so trained.
      Where a pole is used, two stems are sufficient. These should be examined,
      and cut back to the first strong and plump bud, removing the weaker buds
      always found towards the extremity of a stem. Then let the stems so pruned
      lie flat on the earth till the buds break into leaf, after which they are
      to be tied to the pole. If they were tied up immediately, the sap, obeying
      its natural tendency, would flow upward, expanding the highest bud, and
      leaving many of those below dormant, so that a portion of the stem would
      be bare. (The same course of proceeding may be followed with equal
      advantage in the case of wall and trellis roses.) The highest bud now
      throws up a strong leading shoot, while the stem below becomes furnished
      with an abundance of small side-shoots. In the following spring, the
      leading shoot is to be pruned back to the first strong bud, and the
      treatment of the previous year repeated. By pursuing this process, the
      pillar may, in the course of two or three years, be enveloped from the
      ground to the summit with a mass of leaves and blossoms.
    </p>
    <p>
      These and all other rose-pruning operations are, in the Northern States,
      best effected in March, or the end of February; since roses pruned in
      autumn are apt to be severely injured and sometimes killed by the severity
      of our winters.

      Nothing is more beneficial to roses than a frequent digging and stirring
      of the soil around them. The surface should never be allowed to become
      hard, but should be kept light and porous by hoeing or forking several
      times in the course of the season. A yearly application of manure will be
      of great advantage. It may be applied in the autumn or in the spring, and
      forked in around the plants. Cultivators who wish to obtain the finest
      possible blooms sometimes apply liquid manure early in the summer,
      immediately after the flower-buds are formed. This penetrates at once to
      the roots, and takes immediate effect on the growing bud.

      The amateur may perhaps draw some useful hints from an experiment made by
      the writer in cultivating roses, with a view to obtaining the best
      possible individual flowers. A piece of land about sixty feet long by
      forty wide was "trenched" throughout to the depth of two feet and a half,
      and enriched with three layers of manure. The first was placed at eighteen
      inches from the surface; the second, at about nine inches; and the third
      was spread on the surface itself, and afterwards dug in. The virgin soil
      was a dense yellow loam of considerable depth; and, by the operation of
      "trenching," it was thoroughly mixed and incorporated with the black
      surface soil. Being too stiff and heavy, a large quantity of sandy
      road-scrapings was laid on with the surface-dressing of manure. When the
      ground was prepared, the roses were planted in rows. They consisted of
      Hardy June, Moss, Hybrid Perpetual, Bourbon, and a few of the more hardy
      Noisette roses. They were planted early in spring, and cut back at the
      same time close to the ground. Many of the Perpétuais and Bourbons
      flowered the first season, and all grew with a remarkable vigor. In
      November, just before the ground froze, a spadesman, working backward
      midway between the rows, dug a trench of the depth and width of his spade,
      throwing the earth in a ridge upon the roots of the roses as he proceeded.
      This answered a double purpose. The ridge of earth protected the roots and
      several inches of the stems, while the trench acted as a drain. In the
      spring, the earth of the ridge was drawn back into the trench with a hoe,
      and the roses pruned with great severity; some of the weak-growing
      Perpetuals and Mosses being cut to within two inches of the earth, and all
      the weak and sickly stems removed altogether. The whole ground was then
      forked over. The bloom was abundant, and the flowers of uncommon size and
      symmetry. Had the pruning been less severe, the mass of bloom would have
      been greater, but the individual flowers by no means of so good quality.

      Of budded roses we shall speak hereafter, in treating of propagation.
      There is one kind, however, which it will be well to notice here. In
      England and on the Continent, it is a common practice to bud roses on tall
      stems or standards of the Dog Rose, or other strong stock, sometimes at a
      height of five feet or more from the ground. The head of bloom thus
      produced has a very striking effect, especially when the budded rose is of
      a variety with long slender shoots, adapted to form what is called a
      "weeper."

      In France, standard roses are frequently planted near together in circular
      or oval beds, the tallest stems being in the centre, and the rest
      diminishing in regular gradation to the edge of the bed, which is
      surrounded with dwarf roses. Thus a mound or hill of bloom is produced
      with a very striking and beautiful effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, the severe cold and sudden changes of the Northern States,
      and especially of New England, are very unfavorable to standard roses. The
      hot sun scorches and dries the tall, bare stem; and the sharp cold of
      winter frequently kills, and in almost every case greatly injures, the
      budded rose at the top. It is only by using great and very troublesome
      precaution that standards can here be kept in a thriving condition. This
      may be done most effectually by cutting or loosening the roots on one
      side, laying the rose flat on the ground, and covering it during winter
      under a ridge of earth. Some protection of the stem from the hot sun of
      July and August can hardly be dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p>
      With regard to the mounds of standard roses first mentioned, it is
      scarcely worth while to attempt them here; but a very good substitute is
      within our reach. By choosing roses with a view to their different degrees
      of vigor,&mdash;planting the tall and robust kinds in the middle, and
      those of more moderate growth in regular gradation around them,&mdash;we
      may imitate the French mounds without the necessity of employing
      standards. Of course it will require time, and also judicious pruning, to
      perfect such a bed of roses; but, when this is done, it will be both a
      beautiful and permanent ornament of the lawn or garden.

      A new mode of growing roses, so as to form a tall pyramid instead of a
      standard, has been recently introduced in England. Instead of inserting
      buds at the top of the stem only, they are inserted at intervals
      throughout its whole length, thus clothing it with verdure and flowers. By
      this means it is effectually protected from the sun, and one of the
      dangers which in our climate attend standard roses is averted. The
      following directions are copied from a late number of the "Gardener's
      Chronicle:"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some strong two-years-old stocks of the Manetti Rose should be planted in
      November, in a piece of ground well exposed to sun and air. The soil
      should have dressings of manure, and be stirred to nearly two feet in
      depth. In the months of July and August of the following year, they will
      be in a fit state to bud. They should have one bud inserted in each stock
      close to the ground. The sort to be chosen for this preliminary budding is
      a very old Hybrid China Rose, called Madame Pisaroni; a rose with a most
      vigorous and robust habit, which, budded on strong Manet-ti stocks, will
      often make shoots from six to seven feet in length, and stout and robust
      in proportion. In the month of February following, the stocks in which are
      live buds should be all cut down to within six inches of the bud. In May,
      the buds will begin to shoot vigorously: if there are more shoots than one
      from each bud, they must be removed, leaving only one, which in June
      should be supported with a slight stake, or the wind may displace it.
    </p>
    <p>
      "By the end of August, this shoot ought to be from five to six feet in
      height, and is then in a proper state for budding to form a pyramid. Some
      of the most free-growing and beautiful of the Hybrid Perpetual roses
      should be selected, and budded on these stems in the following manner:
      Commence about nine inches from the ground, inserting one bud; then on the
      opposite side of the stock, and at the same distance from the lower bud,
      insert another; and then at the same distance another and another; so that
      buds are on all sides of the tree up to about five feet in height, which,
      in the aggregate, may amount to nine buds. "You will thus have formed the
      foundation of a pyramid. I need scarcely add that the shoots from the
      stock must be carefully removed during the growing season, so as to throw
      all its strength into the buds. It will also be advisable to pinch in the
      three topmost buds rather severely the first season, or they will, to use
      a common expression, draw up the sap too rapidly, and thus weaken the
      lower buds. In the course of a year or two, magnificent pyramids may thus
      be formed, their stems completely covered with foliage, and far surpassing
      any thing yet seen in rose culture."

      Another new method of culture is put forward in recent French and English
      journals, and is said to have proved very successful, increasing both the
      size of the flowers and the period of bloom. I cannot speak of it from
      trial; but, as it may be found worth an experiment, I extract from the
      "Florist and Pomologist" the account there given of the process by a Mr.
      Perry, who was one of the first to practise it. He says,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "As I have now spoken of the advantages attendant upon this mode of
      training, I will proceed to explain the method of carrying it out. I will
      suppose that the plants are well established, and are either on their own
      roots, or budded low on the Manetti (the former I prefer). The operation
      of bending and pegging-down should be performed in the month of March, or
      early in April. All the small growth should be cut clean away, and the
      ends of the strong shoots cut off to the extent only of a few inches.
      These shoots should then be carefully bent to the ground, and fastened
      down by means of strong wooden pegs, sufficiently stout to last the
      season, and to retain the branches in their proper positions. Care must be
      taken that the branches do not split off at the base; but the operator
      will soon perceive which is the best and easiest mode of bending the tree
      to his wishes. Many shoots will spring up from the base of the plants, too
      strong to produce summer blooms; but most of them will gratify the
      cultivator will such noble flowers in the autumn that will delight the
      heart of any lover of this queen of flowers. These branches will be the
      groundwork for the next year. I have recently been engaged in cutting all
      the old wood away which last season did such good duty, and am now
      furnished with an ample supply of snoots from four to eight feet high,
      which, if devoid of leaves, would strongly remind me of fine
      raspberry-canes, and which, by their appearance, promise what they will do
      for the forthcoming season. I would suggest that these long shoots should
      now be merely bundled together, and a stake put to each plant, so as to
      prevent their being injured by the wind. In this state let them remain
      until the latter end of March, and then proceed as I have before
      mentioned. I feel convinced, that, when this method of pegging-down and
      dwarfing stronggrowing roses becomes generally known, many of the justly
      esteemed and valuable robust show varieties will occupy the position in
      our flower-gardens they are justly entitled to."

      A good soil, a good situation, free air and full sun, joined with good
      manuring, good pruning, and good subsequent culture, will prevent more
      diseases than the most skilful practitioner would ever be able to cure.
      There are certain diseases, however, to which roses, under the best
      circumstances, are more or less liable. Of these, the most common, and
      perhaps the worst, is mildew. It consists in the formation on the leaves
      and stems of û sort of minute fungus, sometimes presenting the appearance
      of a white frost. Though often thought to be the result of dampness, it
      frequently appears in the dryest weather. Many of the Bourbon roses, and
      those of the Hybrid Perpétuais nearest akin to the Bourbons, are
      peculiarly liable to it. In the greenhouse, the best remedy is sulphur,
      melted and evaporated at a heat not high enough to cause it to burn. In
      the open air, the flour of sulphur may be sifted over the diseased plants.
      English florists use a remedy against mildew and other kinds of fungus,
      which is highly recommended, but of which I cannot speak from trial. It
      consists in syringing the plants affected with a solution of two ounces of
      blue vitriol dissolved in a largo stable bucket of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst enemies of the rose belong to the insect world. Of these there
      are four, which, in this part of the country, cause far more mischief than
      all the rest combined. The first is the aphis, or green fly; the second is
      the rose-slug, or larva of the saw-fly; the third is the leaf-hopper,
      sometimes called the thrip; and the fourth is the small beetle, popularly
      called the rose-bug. The first three are vulnerable, and can be got rid of
      by using the right means. The slug is a small, green, semi-transparent
      grub, which appears on the leaves of the rose about the middle of June,
      eats away their vital part, and leaves nothing but a brown skeleton, till
      at length the whole bush looks as if burned. The aphis clings to the ends
      of young shoots, and sucks out their sap. It is prolific beyond belief,
      and a single one will soon increase to thousands. Both are quickly killed
      by a solution of whale-oil soap, or a strong decoction of tobacco, which
      should be applied with a syringe in the morning or evening, as the
      application of any liquid to the leaves of a plant under the hot sun is
      always injurious. The same remedy will kill the leaf-hopper, which, being
      much more agile than the others, is best assailed on a cold day, when its
      activity is to some degree chilled out of it. Both sides of the leaves
      should be syringed, and the plant thoroughly saturated with the soap or
      tobacco-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two thorough and well-timed applications will suffice to destroy the
      year's crop of slugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rose-bug is endowed with a constitution which defies tobacco and soap;
      and, though innumerable remedies have been proposed, we know no better
      plan than to pick them off the bushes by hand, or, watching a time when
      they are chilled with cold, to shake them off upon a cloth laid on the
      ground beneath. In either case, sure work should be made of them by
      scalding or crushing them to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following account of the rose-bug and the slug is from Dr. Harris's
      work on "Insects Injurious to Vegetation:"&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The saw-fly of the rose, which, as it does not seem to have been
      described before, may be called <i>Selandria Rosae</i>, from its favorite
      plant, so nearly resembles the slug-worm saw-fly as not to be
      distinguished therefrom except by a practised observer. It is also very
      much like <i>Selandria barda, Vitis</i>, and <i>pygmaea</i>, but has not
      the red thorax of these three closely-allied species. It is of a deep and
      shining black color. The first two pairs of legs are brownish-gray, or
      dirty white, except the thighs, which are almost entirely black. The hind
      legs are black, with whitish knees. The wings are smoky and transparent,
      with dark-brown veins, and a brown spot near the middle of the edge of the
      first pair. The body of the male is a little more than three-twentieths of
      an inch long; that of the female, one-fifth of an inch or more; and the
      wings expand nearly or quite two-fifths of an inch. These saw-flies come
      out of the ground at various times between the 20th of May and the middle
      of June, during which period they pair, and lay their eggs. The females do
      not fly much, and may be seen, during most of the day, resting on the
      leaves; and, when touched, they draw up their legs, and fall to the
      ground. The males are now active, fly from one rose-bush to another, and
      hover around their sluggish partners. The latter, when about to lay their
      eggs, turn a little on one side, unsheathe their saws, and thrust them
      obliquely into the skin of the leaf, depositing in each incision thus made
      a single egg. The young begin to hatch in ten days or a fortnight after
      the eggs are laid. They may sometimes be found on the leaves as early as
      the 1st of June, but do not usually appear in considerable numbers till
      the 20th of the same month. How long they are in coming to maturity, I
      have not particularly observed; but the period of their existence in the
      caterpillar state probably does not exceed three weeks. They somewhat
      resemble young slug-worms in form, but are not quite so convex. They have
      a small, round, yellowish head, with a black dot on each side of it; and
      are provided with twenty-two short legs. The body is green above, paler at
      the sides, and yellowish beneath; and it is soft and almost transparent,
      like jelly. The skin of the back is transversely wrinkled, and covered
      with minute elevated points; and there are two small, triple-pointed warts
      on the edge of the first ring, immediately behind the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The gelatinous and sluggish creatures eat the upper surface of the leaf
      in large, irregular patches, leaving the veins and the skin beneath
      untouched; and they are sometimes so thick, that not a leaf on the bushes
      is spared by them, and the whole foliage looks as if it had been scorched
      by fire, and drops off soon afterwards. They cast their skins several
      times, leaving them extended and fastened on the leaves: after the last
      moulting, they lose their semi-transparent and greenish color, and acquire
      an opaque yellowish hue. They then leave the rose-bushes; some of them
      slowly creeping down the stem, and others rolling up and dropping off,
      especially when the bushes are shaken by the wind. Having reached the
      ground, they burrow to the depth of an inch or more in the earth, where
      each one makes for itself a small oval cell of grains of earth, cemented
      with a little gummy silk. Having finished their transformations, and
      turned to flies within their cells, they come out of the ground early in
      August, and lay their eggs for a second brood of young. These, in turn,
      perform their appointed work of destruction in the autumn: they then go
      into the ground, make their earthen cells, remain therein throughout the
      winter, and appear in the winged form in the following spring and summer.
      During several years past, these pernicious vermin have infested the
      rose-bushes in the vicinity of Boston, and have proved so injurious to
      them as to have elicited the attention of the Massachusetts Horticultural
      Society, by whom a premium of one hundred dollars, for the most successful
      mode of destroying these insects, was offered in the summer of 1840. In
      the year 1832, I first observed them in the gardens in Cambridge, and then
      made myself acquainted with their transformations. At that time they had
      not reached Milton, my former place of residence; and they did not appear
      in that place till six or seven years later. They now seem to be gradually
      extending in all directions; and an effectual method for preserving our
      roses from their attacks has become very desirable to all persons who set
      any value on this beautiful ornament of our gardens and shrubberies.
      Showering or syringing the bushes, with a liquor made by mixing with water
      the juice expressed from tobacco by tobacconists, has been recommended:
      but some caution is necessary in making this mixture of a proper strength;
      for, if too strong, it is injurious to plants; and the experiment does not
      seem, as yet, to have been conducted with sufficient care to insure safety
      and success. Dusting lime over the plants, when wet with dew, has been
      tried, and found of some use; but this and all other remedies will
      probably yield in efficacy to Mr. Haggerston's mixture of whale-oil soap
      and water, in the proportion of two pounds of the soap to fifteen gallons
      of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Particular directions, drawn up by Mr. Haggerston himself, for the
      preparation and use of this simple and cheap application, may be found in
      the 'Boston Courier' for the 25th of June, 1841, and also in most of our
      agricultural and horticultural journals of the same time. The utility of
      this mixture has already been repeatedly mentioned in this treatise, and
      it may be applied in other cases with advantage. Mr. Haggerston finds that
      it effectually destroys many kinds of insects; and he particularly
      mentions plant-lice, red spiders, canker-worms, and a little jumping
      insect, which has lately been found quite as hurtful to rose-bushes as the
      slugs or young of the saw-fly. The little insect alluded to has been
      mistaken for a Thrips, or vinc-frettor: it is, however, a leaf-hopper, or
      species of <i>Tettiyonia</i>, and is described in a former part of this
      treatise.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rose-chafer, or rose-bug as it is more commonly and incorrectly
      called, is also a diurnal insect. It is the <i>Melolontha subspinosa</i>
      of Fabricius, by whom it was first described, and belongs to the modern
      genus <i>Macrodaclylus</i> of Latreille. Common as this insect is in the
      vicinity of Boston, it is, or was a few years ago, unknown in the northern
      and western parts of Massachusetts, in New Hampshire, and in Maine. It
      may, therefore, be well to give a brief description of it. This beetle
      measures seven-twentieths of an inch in length. Its body is slender,
      tapers before and behind, and is entirely covered with very short and
      close ashen-yellow down; the thorax is long and narrow, angularly widened
      in the middle of each side, which suggested the name <i>subspinosa</i>, or
      somewhat spined; the legs are slender, and of a pale-red color; the joints
      of the feet are tipped with black, and are very long; which caused
      Latreille to call the genus <i>Macrodactylus</i>: that is, long toe, or
      long foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The natural history of the rose-chafer, one of the greatest scourges with
      which our gardens and nurseries have been afflicted, was for a long time
      involved in mystery, but is at last fully cleared up. The prevalence of
      this insect on the rose, and its annual appearance coinciding with the
      blossoming of that flower, have gained for it the popular name by which it
      is here known. For some time after they were first noticed, rose-bugs
      appeared to be confined to their favorite, the blossoms of the rose; but
      within forty years they have prodigiously increased in number, have
      attacked at random various kinds of plants in swarms, and have become
      notorious for their extensive and deplorable ravages. The grape-vine, in
      particular, the cherry, plum, and apple trees, have annually suffered by
      their depredations: many other fruit-trees and shrubs, garden vegetables
      and corn, and even the trees of the forest and the grass of the fields,
      have been laid under contribution by these indiscriminate feeders, by whom
      leaves, flowers, and fruits are alike consumed. The unexpected arrival of
      these insects in swarms at their first coming, and their sudden
      disappearance at the close of their career, are remarkable facts in their
      history. They come forth from the ground during the second week in June,
      or about the time of the blossoming of the damask-rose, and remain from
      thirty to forty days. At the end of this period the males become
      exhausted, fall to the ground, and perish; while the females enter the
      earth, lay their eggs, return to the surface, and, after lingering a few
      days, die also.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The eggs laid by each female are about thirty in number, and are
      deposited from one to four inches beneath the surface of the soil: they
      are nearly globular, whitish, and about one-thirtieth of an inch in
      diameter, and are hatched twenty days after they are laid. The young larvæ
      begin to feed on such tender roots as are within their reach. Like other
      grubs of the Scarabæians, when not eating they lie upon the side, with the
      body covered, so that the head and tail are nearly in contact: they move
      with difficulty on a level surface, and are continually falling over on
      one side or the other. They attain their full size in the autumn, being
      then nearly three-quarters of an inch long, and about an eighth of an inch
      in diameter. They are of a yellowish-white color, with a tinge of blue
      towards the hinder extremity, which is thick, and obtuse or rounded. A few
      short hairs are scattered on the surface of the body. There are six short
      legs; namely, a pair to each of the first three rings behind the head: and
      the latter is covered with a horny shell of a pale rust color. In October
      they descend below the reach of frost, and pass the winter in a torpid
      state. In the spring they approach towards the surface, and each one forms
      for itself a little cell of an oval shape by turning round a great many
      times, so as to compress the earth, and render the inside of the cavity
      hard and smooth. Within this cell the grub is transformed to a pupa during
      the month of May by casting off its skin, which is pushed downwards in
      folds from the head to the tail. The pupa has somewhat the form of the
      perfected beetle, but is of a yellowish-white color; its short, stump-like
      wings, its antennæ, and its legs, are folded upon the breast; and its
      whole body is enclosed in a thin film, that wraps each part separately.
      During the month of June, this filmy skin is rent: the included beetle
      withdraws from its body and its limbs, bursts open its earthen cell, and
      digs its way to the surface of the ground. Thus the various changes, from
      the egg to the full development of the perfected beetle, are completed
      within the space of one year.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Such being the metamorphoses and habits of these insects, it is evident
      that we cannot attack them in the egg, the grub, or the pupa state: the
      enemy in these stages is beyond our reach, and is subject to the control
      only of the natural but unknown means appointed by the Author of Nature to
      keep the insect tribes in check. When they have issued from their
      subterranean retreats, and have congregated upon our vines, trees, and
      other vegetable productions, in the complete enjoyment of their
      propensities, we must unite our efforts to seize and crush the invaders.
      They must indeed be crushed, scalded, or burned, to deprive them of life;
      for they are not affected by any of the applications usually found
      destructive to other insects. Experience has proved the utility of
      gathering them by hand, or of shaking them or brushing them from the
      plants into tin vessels containing a little water. They should be
      collected daily during the period of their visitation, and should be
      committed to the flames, or killed by scalding water. The late John
      Lowell, Esq., states that, in 1823, he discovered on a solitary apple-tree
      the rose-bugs 'in vast numbers, such as could not be described, and would
      not be believed if they were described, or at least none but an ocular
      witness could conceive of their numbers. Destruction by hand was out of
      the question,' in this case. He put sheets under the tree, shook them
      down, and burned them.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dr. Green of Mansfield, whose investigations have thrown much light on
      the history of this insect, proposes protecting plants with millinet, and
      says that in this way only did he succeed in securing his grape-vines from
      depredation. His remarks also show the utility of gathering them.
      'Eighty-six of these spoilers,' says he, 'were known to infest a single
      rose-bud, and were crushed with one grasp of the hand.' Suppose, as was
      probably the case, that one-half of them were females: by this
      destruction, eight hundred eggs, at least, were prevented from becoming
      matured. During the time of their prevalence, rose-bugs are sometimes
      found in immense numbers on the flowers of the common white-weed, or
      ox-eyed daisy (<i>Chrysanthemum leucanihemum</i>); a worthless plant,
      which has come to us from Europe, and has been suffered to overrun our
      pastures and encroach on our mowing-lands. In certain cases, it may become
      expedient rapidly to mow down the infested white-weed in dry pastures, and
      consume it, with the sluggish rose-bugs, on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Our insect-eating birds undoubtedly devour many of these insects, and
      deserve to be cherished and protected for their services. Rose-bugs are
      also eaten greedily by domesticated fowls; and when they become exhausted
      and fall to the ground, or when they are about to lay their eggs, they are
      destroyed by moles, insects, and other animals, which lie in wait to seize
      them. Dr. Green informs us that a species of dragon-fly, or
      devil's-needle, devours them. He also says that an insect, which he calls
      the enemy of the cut-worm (probably the larva of a Carabus or predaceous
      ground-beetle), preys on the grubs of the common dor-bug. In France, the
      golden ground-beetle (<i>Carabus auratus</i>) devours the female dor, or
      chafer, at the moment when she is about to deposit her eggs. I have taken
      one specimen of this fine ground-beetle in Massachusetts; and we have
      several other kinds equally predaceous, which probably contribute to check
      the increase of our native Melolonthians."

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>ANY OF the
      ever-blooming roses cannot, in our climate, be cultivated in the open air
      without extreme precaution to protect them from the cold. To grow them
      most successfully, the aid of glass is necessary. Many of the Hardy
      Perpetual roses may also be grown with advantage in pots, by which means
      their bloom may be prolonged into the early winter months, or they may be
      forced into premature flowering long before their natural season of bloom.
      The first essential in the pot culture of roses is the preparation of the
      soil. Those of delicate growth, like most of the China and Tea roses,
      require a lighter soil than the more robust varieties, like most of the
      Hardy Perpetuals. A mixture of loam, manure, leaf-mould, and sand, in the
      proportion of two bushels of loam to one bushel of manure, one bushel of
      leaf-mould, and half a bushel of sand, makes a good soil for the more
      delicate roses. For the more robust kinds, the proportion of loam and of
      manure should be greater. In all cases, the materials should be mixed two
      or three months before they are wanted for use, and turned over several
      times to incorporate them thoroughly. They are frequently, however, mixed,
      and used at once. The best loam is that composed of thoroughly rotted
      turf. A very skilful English rose-grower, Mr. Rivers, recommends the
      compact turf shaved from the surface of an old pasture, and roasted and
      partially charred on a sheet of iron over a moderate fire. I have found no
      enriching material so good as the sweepings from the floor of a
      horse-shoer, in which manure is mixed with the shavings of hoofs. It is
      light and porous, and furnishes, in decomposing, a great quantity of
      ammonia. For the more delicate roses it is particularly suited, while the
      stronger kinds will bear manures of a stronger and denser nature. The
      light black soil from the woods is an excellent substitute for leaf-mould;
      or, to speak more correctly, it is a natural leaf-mould in the most
      thorough state of decomposition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young and thrifty roses which have been grown during summer may be potted
      for the house in September. They should be taken up with care, the large
      straggling roots cut back, and all bruised ends removed with a sharp
      knife. The ends of the branches should also be cut back. They may then be
      potted in the compost just described, which should first be sifted through
      a very coarse sieve. The pots must be well drained with broken crocks
      placed over the hole at the bottom. Care must be taken that the pot be not
      too large, as this is very injurious. A sharp stick may be used to compact
      the soil about the roots; and from half an inch to an inch in depth should
      be left empty at the top, to assist in thorough watering, which is a point
      of the first importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the roses are potted, they should be placed in a light cellar or
      shed, or under a shady wall. They must be well watered, and it is well to
      syringe them occasionally. In a week or two they will have become
      established, and may then be removed to a greenhouse without fire, and
      with plenty of air; care, however, being taken to protect them from frost
      at night.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses so treated are intended for blooming from mid-winter to the end
      of spring; and we shall soon speak further of them under the head of
      Forcing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great desideratum is the obtaining of roses in the early part of winter.
      This may be done by growing everblooming roses in pots in the open air
      during summer, plunging the pot in the earth, and placing a tile or brick
      beneath it to prevent the egress of roots and the ingress of worms.
      Towards the end of August, cut off all the flowers and buds, at the same
      time shortening the flower-stalks to two or three eyes. Then give the
      roses a supply of manure-water to stimulate their growth. If they are in a
      thrifty condition, they will form new shoots and flower-buds before the
      frost sets in; and may then be removed to a cold greenhouse, where they
      will continue, to flower for several months.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is the description given by Mr. Rivers of a practice
      recently introduced in England, and which seems well worth a trial here,
      with such modifications as the heat of our sun may require:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "To have a fine bloom of these roses, or, indeed, of any of the Hybrid
      Perpetuals, Bourbons, or China roses, in pots towards the end of summer or
      autumn, take plants from small pots (those struck from cuttings in March
      or April will do), and put them into six-inch, or even eight-inch pots,
      using a compost of light turfy loam and rotten manure, equal parts: to a
      bushel of the compost add half a peck of pounded charcoal, and the same
      quantity of silver sand; make a hot-bed of sufficient strength, say three
      to four feet in height, of seasoned dung, so that it is not of a burning
      heat, in a sunny, exposed situation,' and on this place the pots; then
      fill up all interstices with sawdust, placing it so as to cover the rims,
      and to lie on the surface of the mould in the pots about two inches deep.
      The pots should have a good sound watering before they are thus plunged,
      and have water daily in dry weather. The bottom heat and full exposure to
      the sun and air will give the plants a vigor almost beyond belief. This
      very simple mode of culture is as yet almost unknown. I have circulated
      among a few friends the above directions; and have no doubt, that, in the
      hands of skilful gardeners, some extraordinary results may be looked for
      in the production of specimens of soft-wooded plants. I may add, that,
      when the heat of the bed declines towards the middle of July, the pots
      must be removed, some fresh dung added, and the bed remade, again plunging
      the plants immediately. Towards the end of August, the roots of the plants
      must be ripened: the pots must, therefore, be gradually lifted out of the
      saw-dust; i.e., for five or six days, expose them about two inches below
      their rims; then, after the same lapse of time, a little lower, till the
      whole of the pot is exposed to the sun and air: they may be then removed
      to the greenhouse, so as to be sheltered from heavy rain. They will bloom
      well in the autumn, and be in fine order for early forcing. If plants are
      required during the summer for exhibition, or any other purpose, care must
      always be taken to harden or ripen their roots, as above, before they are
      removed from the hot-bed."

    <p>
      "Forcing" is the very inappropriate name of the process by which roses and
      other plants are induced to bloom under glass in advance of their natural
      season. We say that the name is inappropriate, because one of the chief
      essentials to the success of the process consists in an abstinence from
      all that is violent or sudden, and in the gentle and graduated application
      of the stimulus of artificial heat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roses may be forced in the greenhouse, but not to advantage, because the
      conditions of success will be inconsistent with the requirements of many
      of the other plants. The process is best carried on in a small glass
      structure made for such purposes, and called a "forcing-pit."
    </p>
    <p>
      A pit ten or twelve feet long and eight or ten wide will commonly be large
      enough. It may be of the simplest and cheapest construction. In a dry
      situation, there is advantage in sinking the lower part of it two or three
      feet below the surface of the ground. The roses may be placed on beds of
      earth, or on wooden platforms, so arranged as to bring the top of the
      plants near the glass; and a sunken path may pass down the middle. The pit
      may be heated by a stove enclosed with brick-work, and furnished with a
      flue of brick or tile passing along the front of the pit, and entering the
      chimney at the farther end. The lights must be movable, or other means
      provided' for ample ventilation; and if these are such that the air on
      entering will pass over the heated flues, and thus become warmed in the
      passage, great advantage will result. A pit may be appended to a
      greenhouse; in which case it may be heated by hot-water pipes furnished
      with means of cutting off or letting on the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The roses potted for forcing, as directed in the last section, should be
      kept in a dormant state till the middle of December. A portion of them may
      then be brought into the pit, and the young shoots pruned back to two or
      three eyes. The heat at first must be very moderate, not much exceeding
      forty-five degrees in the daytime: and, throughout the process, the pit
      should be kept as cool as possible at night; great care, however, being
      taken that no frost is admitted. With this view, the glass should be
      covered at sunset with thick mats. Syringe the plants as the buds begin to
      swell, and lose no opportunity to give air on mild and bright days. Raise
      the heat gradually till it reaches sixty degrees; which is enough during
      the winter months, so far as fire-heat is concerned. The heat of the sun
      will sometimes raise it to seventy or eighty degrees. Syringe every
      morning; and, if the aphis appears, fumigate with tobacco; then syringe
      forcibly to wash off the dead insects. As the plants advance in growth,
      they require plenty of water; and, as the buds begin to swell,
      manure-water may be applied once or twice. When the buds are ready to
      open, the pots may be removed to the greenhouse or drawing-room, and
      another supply put in their place for a second crop of flowers. When the
      blooms are faded, the flower-stalks may be cut back to two or three eyes,
      and the plants placed again in the forcing-pit for another crop. This, of
      course, is applicable to ever-blooming roses only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most common and simple way, however, of obtaining roses in winter, is
      to grow them on rafters in the greenhouse. Some of the Noisette, China,
      and Tea roses, thus treated, will furnish an abundant supply of excellent
      flowers. By pruning them at different periods during the summer and
      autumn, they will be induced to flower in succession; since, with all
      roses, the time of blooming is, to a great degree, dependent on the time
      of pruning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roses potted in the manner described for forcing may also be brought into
      bloom in the sunny window of a chamber or drawing-room. They will bloom
      much better if allowed to remain at rest in a cool cellar for a month or
      two after potting.

      The following is a cheap mode of forcing, described by an English
      cultivator. The amateur may, perhaps, be disposed to make the experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Those who wish for the luxury of forced roses at a trifling cost may have
      them by pursuing the following simple method: Take a common garden frame,
      large or small, according to the number of roses wanted; raise it on some
      posts, so that the bottom edge will be about three feet from the ground at
      the back of the frame, and two feet in front, sloping to the south. If it
      is two feet deep, this will give a depth of five feet under the lights at
      the back of the frame, which will admit roses on little stems as well as
      dwarfs. Grafted or budded plants of any of the Perpetual roses should be
      potted in October, in a rich compost of equal portions of rotten dung and
      loam, in pots about eight inches deep and seven inches over, and plunged
      in the soil at the bottom. The air in the frame may be heated by linings
      of hot dung; but care must be taken that the dung be turned over two or
      three times before it is used, otherwise the rank and noxious steam will
      kill the young and tender shoots: but the hazard of this may be avoided by
      building a wall of turf, three inches thick, from the ground to the bottom
      edge of the frame. This will admit the heat through it, and exclude the
      steam. The Perpetual roses, thus made to bloom early, are really
      beautiful."

      Now, in the way of exciting the reader's emulation, I will mention a few
      items of the opening flower-show of the Crystal Palace, Sydenham, on the
      26th of May, a few years ago. The following specimens of roses, in pots,
      are chronicled among innumerable others:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Willeemoz (<i>Tea-scented Rose</i>), seven feet high, with more
      than a hundred expanded flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Souvenir de la Malmaison (<i>Bourbon Rose</i>), with thirty expanded
      flowers, the largest more than five inches in diameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Pereas (<i>Hybrid Bourbon Rose</i>), six feet high, with nearly a
      hundred expanded flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coupe d'Hébé (<i>Hybrid Bourbon Rose</i>), six feet high, covered with a
      mass of bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were all raised by Mr. Paul, one of the most skilful of English
      rose-growers; and were the results of patience, care, and experience. We
      hold the production of specimens like these a work of art worthy of
      zealous emulation. Our climate is quite as favorable to their production
      as that of England; and, when the floricultural art has reached among us
      the same development, our horticultural shows will, no doubt, boast
      decorations equally splendid. The plants just mentioned were the
      productions of a nurseryman; but specimens of roses grown to the highest
      perfection are every year exhibited in England by amateur cultivators. The
      competition for prizes, far from being a mere strife for a small sum of
      money, is an honorable emulation, in which the credit of success is the
      winner's best reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      One point cannot be too often urged in respect to horticultural pursuits.
      Never attempt to do any thing which you are not prepared to do thoroughly.
      A little done well is far more satisfactory than a great deal done
      carelessly and superficially. He who raises one perfect and fully
      developed specimen of a plant is a better horticulturist than he who
      raises an acre of indifferent specimens. The amateur who has made himself
      a thorough master of the cultivation of a single species or variety, has,
      of necessity, acquired a knowledge and skill, which, with very little
      pains, he may apply to numberless other forms of culture. Learn to produce
      a first-class specimen of the rose grown in a pot, and you will have no
      difficulty in successfully applying your observation and experience to a
      vast variety of plants. We will, therefore, enter into some detail as to
      the methods of procedure. For many of the specific directions I am
      indebted to Mr. Paul, the exhibiter of the fine specimens named above, and
      the author, among other books, of a useful little treatise on the
      cultivation of roses in pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Soil</i> is the point that first demands attention, and directions
      concerning it have already been given. You have bought a number of young
      roses, in small pots, in the spring. Be sure that these roses have been in
      a dormant state during the winter; for, if they have been kept in growth,
      their vital power is partially exhausted. They may be budded on short
      stems of the Manetti or other good stock (see the chapter on <i>Budding</i>),
      or they may be on their own roots. The Tea and China roses are certainly
      better in the latter condition. Shift them from the small pots into pots a
      very little larger, without breaking the ball of earth around their roots.
      Water them well, and plunge them to the edge of the pot in earth, in an
      open, airy, sunny place. Or they may be set on the surface, provided the
      spaces between them are well packed with tan, coal-ashes, or swamp-moss.
      The last is excellent: it holds moisture like a sponge. In every case, the
      pots should rest on flat bricks, slates, tiles, or inverted pans, in order
      that worms may be excluded, and that the roots may not be tempted to
      thrust themselves through the hole. In potting, thorough drainage should
      be secured by placing broken crocks at the bottom of the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encourage the growth of the plants by pinching off the flower-buds. The
      object throughout the summer is to get a few stout well-ripened shoots by
      autumn. Therefore the pots should not be very close together, since this
      would deprive the plants of free air and sunlight. Watering must be
      carefully attended to. Cut out, or pinch off, weak or ill-placed shoots;
      or, what is better, prevent their growth by rubbing off the buds that
      threaten to form such. Thus, if several buds are crowded together in one
      place, rub off all but one or two of them, choosing the strongest for
      preservation. This is called <i>dis-budding</i>. Those of the plants that
      grow most vigorously will require to be shifted into still larger pots in
      July; but this should be done only in cases where it is necessary. As a
      guide on this point, turn them carefully out of the pots to examine the
      roots; and, if these are found protruding in great abundance from the ball
      of earth, larger pots will be required; but, if otherwise, the same one
      will suffice. Some roses suffer greatly if placed in pots too large for
      them; and the same is more or less true of all plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in autumn, when growth has ceased, shift the roses again, if they
      need it, and place them for wintering in a cellar or cold frame. In the
      spring, prune them, as directed in the chapter on Pruning. After the rose
      is pruned, stake out the shoots to as great distances as possible. Indeed,
      the larger ones should be made to lie almost horizontal: this will cause
      the buds to "break," or open, regularly along their whole length; whereas,
      if left upright, a few at the top would break, and the rest remain
      dormant. As soon as the buds have opened, the shoots may be tied up again.
      Syringe the opening buds, and water moderately, increasing the amount of
      moisture as the leaves expand, and watering abundantly during all the
      period of full activity of growth; that is, during summer and early
      autumn. An occasional application of manure-water is useful. Watch for
      insects and mildew, and apply the remedies elsewhere directed. About
      midsummer, shift those that need it into larger pots; an operation which,
      if performed with skill, will not check their growth in the least.
      Continue to disbud and to remove weak and ill-placed shoots, tying out the
      rest, as they grow, to stakes, in order to bring the plant into a
      symmetrical form. This form is a matter of taste with the cultivator: it
      may be a half-globe, a fan, or a pyramid or cone. The last is usually the
      best; one strong stem being allowed to grow in the centre, and smaller
      stems trained in gradation around it. None must interfere with their
      neighbors, and air should have free play through the plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      You have reached the second autumn, and your plants are now excellent for
      forcing; but, if you aim at first-class specimens, you must give them, at
      the least, one season more of growth and training. To this end, keep them
      dormant through the winter in a cellar or cold frame as before, and prune
      them early in spring. We will suppose that a pyramidal plant is desired.
      As soon as they are pruned, draw the lower shoots downwards over the rim
      of the pot, just beneath which a wire should pass around, to which the
      shoots are to be tied with strings of bass-matting. The shoots higher up
      are to be arranged, with the aid of sticks and strings, so as to decrease
      in circumference till they terminate in a point. Constant care and some
      judgment are needed throughout the growing season to preserve symmetry of
      form. Strong shoots must be pinched back, and weak ones encouraged. Both
      the plant, and the pot that contains it, are, or ought to be, so large by
      this time, that handling them, especially in the act of shifting, becomes
      somewhat difficult. In the third, or at farthest in the fourth autumn, you
      may expect, as the result of your pains, a plant that in its blooming
      season will make a brilliant contrast with the half-grown and indifferent
      specimens sometimes exhibited at our horticultural shows.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you forget every other point of the above directions, keep in mind the
      following: Drain your pots thoroughly; and, when you water them, be sure
      that you give water enough to penetrate the whole mass of the earth
      contained in them. Watering only the surface, and leaving the roots dry,
      is ruinous.

    </h5>
    <p>
      This is perhaps, for the amateur, the most convenient and certain method.
      The best season for layering is the summer, from the end of June to the
      end of August; and, for some varieties, even later. The rose which is to
      be multiplied should be in a condition of vigorous growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Loosen and pulverize the soil around it; and, if heavy and adhesive, add a
      liberal quantity of very old manure mixed with its bulk of sharp sand. The
      implements needed for the operation are a knife, a trowel, and hooked
      wooden pegs. Choose a well-ripened shoot of the same season's growth, and
      strip off the leaves from its base a foot or more up the stalk; but, by
      all means, suffer the leaves at the end to remain. Bend the shoot gently
      downward with the left hand, and insert the edge of the knife in its upper
      or inner side six or eight inches from its base, and immediately below a
      bud. Cut half way through the stem; then turn the edge of the knife
      upward, and cautiously slit the stem through the middle, to the length of
      an inch and a half, thus a tongue of wood, with a bud at its end, will be
      formed. With the thumb and finger of the left hand raise the upper part of
      the stem erect, at the same time by a slight twist turning the tongue
      aside, steadying the stem meanwhile with the right hand. Thus the tongue
      will be brought to a right angle, or nearly so, with the part of the stem
      from which it was cut. Hold it in this position with the left hand, while
      with the trowel you make a slit in the soil just beneath it. Into this
      insert the tongue and bent part of the stem to a depth not much exceeding
      two inches. Press the earth firmly round them, and pin them down with one
      of the hooked pegs. Some operators cut the tongue on the lower or outer
      side of the stem; but this has a double disadvantage. In the first place,
      the stem is much more liable to break in being bent; and, in the next
      place, the tongue is liable to re-unite with the cut part, and thus defeat
      the operation. When all is finished, the extremity of the shoot should
      stand out of the ground as nearly upright as possible, and should by no
      means be cut back,&mdash;a mistaken practice in use with some gardeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a favorable season, most of the layers will be well rooted before the
      frost sets in. If the weather is very dry, there will be many failures.
      Instead of roots, a hard cellular substance will form in a ball around the
      tongue. In the dry summer of 1864, the rose-layers were thus "clubbed"
      with lumps often as large as a hen's egg; but cases like this are rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In November, it is better in our severe climate to take up the rooted
      layers, and keep them during winter in a "cold frame;" that is, a frame
      constructed like that of a hot-bed, without the heat. Here they should be
      set closely in light soil to the depth of at least six inches, and covered
      with boards and matting; or they may be potted in small pots, and placed
      in a frame or cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Layers may be made in spring from wood of the last season's growth; but
      laying the young wood during slimmer, as described above, is much to be
      preferred.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Ill 0072]
    </p>
    <p>
      All roses may be propagated by cuttings; but some kinds strike root much
      more readily than others. The hard-wooded roses, including the entire
      family of the Hardy June roses, and especially the Mosses, are increased
      with difficulty by cuttings. The Hybrid Perpétuais root more readily;
      while the tender ever-blooming roses, including the Teas, Noisettes, and
      Chinas, are propagated in this way with great ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuttings may be made from the ripened or the half-ripened wood. In the
      case of roses, and of nearly all ligneous plants, cuttings made from the
      ripe wood do not require bottom-heat, and are more likely to be injured
      than benefited by it. On the other hand, cuttings of the soft or unripe
      wood strike root with more quickness and certainty if stimulated by the
      application of a gentle heat from below.
    </p>
    <p>
      In propagating roses from the ripe wood, the cuttings must be made early
      in autumn from wood of the same season's growth. The chances of success
      will be increased if they are taken off close to the old wood with what is
      called a "heel;" that is, with a very small portion of the old wood
      attached. The heel should be trimmed smooth with a sharp knife: the
      cuttings may be six or eight inches long. Strip off any leaves which may
      still adhere to them, and plant them in rows, at a depth of about five
      inches, in a cold frame. The soil should be very light, and thoroughly
      drained: water it, to settle it, around the cuttings. On the approach of
      frost, they should be protected with boards and mats, giving them air on
      fine days during winter. In the spring, a white cellular growth called a
      "callus" will have formed at the heel of each cutting, which, if the
      process succeeds, will soon emit roots, and become a plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Propagation in summer from the half-ripe wood is a better and less
      uncertain method. In June and July, immediately after the blossoms wither,
      and before the rose has begun its second growth, cuttings should be made
      of the flower-stems. Each cutting may contain two or three buds. The lower
      leaves must be taken off; but the upper leaves must remain. Trim off the
      stem smoothly with a sharp knife below the lowest bud, and as near to it
      as possible without injuring it.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the cuttings are taken off with a heel, as above described, the chance
      of success will be greater. They may now be inserted at the depth of an
      inch and a half around the edge of a small pot filled one-third with
      broken crocks, and the remainder with a mixture of loam, leaf-mould, and
      sharp sand. Now place them in a frame on the shady side of a hedge or
      fence, water them to settle the soil, and cover them closely with glass.
      Sprinkle them lightly every morning and night; and, when moisture gathers
      on the inner surface of the glass, turn it over, placing the dry side
      inward. If mould or decay attacks the cuttings, wedge up the glass a
      little to give them air. In a week or two, they will form a callus; after
      which they may be removed to a gentle hot-bed, kept moderately close, and
      shaded from the direct sun. Here they will quickly strike root, and may be
      potted off singly into small pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another mode of propagation, and a favorite one with nursery-men, is
      practised early in the spring. In this case, the cuttings are made from
      forced roses, or roses grown on greenhouse rafters. Some propagators
      prefer the wood in a very soft state, cutting it even before the flowers
      are expanded. The cuttings may be placed in pots as in the former case, or
      in shallow boxes or earthen pans thoroughly drained with broken crocks.
      The soil should be shallow enough to allow the heel of the cutting to
      touch the crocks. They are to be placed at once on a moderate bottom-heat,
      covered closely with glass, and shaded from the direct rays of the
      noontide sun. Their subsequent treatment is similar to that of summer
      cuttings. They must be closely watched, and those that show signs of mould
      or decay at once removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the callus is formed, they will bear more air. When rooted, they
      should be potted into small pots, and placed on a hot-bed of which the
      heat is on the decline. Towards the end of May, when the earth is warmed
      by the sun, they may be turned out of the pots into the open ground, where
      they will soon make strong plants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many American nursery-men strike rose-cuttings in spring, in pure sand,
      over a hot-bed or a tank of hot water, in the close air of the
      propagating-house. They must be potted immediately on rooting, as the sand
      supplies them with nothing to subsist on. We have seen many hundreds
      rooted in this way with scarcely a single failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The management of difficult cuttings requires a certain tact, only to be
      gained by practice and observation; and the gardener who succeeds in
      rooting a pot of cuttings of the Moss Rose has some reason to be proud of
      his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to the relative value of roses propagated by the methods
      above described, the most experienced cultivators are unanimous in the
      opinion, that those raised from layers and from cuttings of the ripe wood,
      without artificial heat, are superior in vigor and endurance to those
      raised from the half-ripe wood with the stimulus of a close heat.
      Unfortunately, the former method is so slow and uncertain when compared
      with the latter, that nurserymen rarely employ it to any great extent; and
      a good choice of roses on their own roots, raised without heat, is
      sometimes difficult to find.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following is a mode of propagation not often practised, but which is
      well worthy of trial, as it is applicable to prunings which are usually
      thrown away. The extract is from the "Gardener's Chronicle."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The rose is as easily propagated by means of buds or eyes as the vine. If
      your correspondent 'X' will take a strong shoot from almost any kind of
      rose in a dormant state, and with a sharp knife cut it into as many pieces
      as there are good eyes on the shoots, the pieces not being more than one
      inch long, taking care to have the eye in the centre of the piece, he will
      doubtless succeed. One-third of the wood should be cut clean off from end
      to end at the back of the eye, just as you would prepare a vine eye. In
      preparing the cutting-pans, it is most essential to put a good quantity of
      broken potsherds in the bottom, beginning with large pieces, and finishing
      with others more finely broken: then mix a quantity of good loam,
      leaf-soil, and sand, in equal proportions; rub it through a fine sieve,
      and fill the pans to within one inch of the top, pressing down the soil
      moderately firm. After that, put in the eyes in a leaning or slanting
      position, pressing them firmly into the soil with the thumb and finger;
      taking care to keep the thumb on the bottom end of the cutting, to prevent
      the bark from being injured. After the eyes are put in, give the pan two
      or three gentle raps on the bench; then put half an inch of silver or
      clean river sand on the top, water with a fine rose, and plunge the pans
      in a nice bottom heat of say sixty degrees, covering the surface over with
      moss to prevent the soil from getting dry: they will not require any more
      water for a week or ten days. The moss should be carefully removed as soon
      as the young shoots begin to push through the sand. In three weeks from
      that time, the roses will be fit for potting off into large sixty-sized
      pots. They should then be placed in a temperature of seventy degrees, when
      they will soon repay the care bestowed on them. I, however, prefer
      grafting on the Manetti stock. I grafted a lot in a dormant state seven
      weeks ago: they are now nice plants, and will be in bloom by May."&mdash;<i>J.

      This mode of propagation is attended with great advantages and great
      evils. A new or rare rose may be increased by it more rapidly and surely
      than by any other means; while roses of feeble growth on their own roots
      will often grow and bloom vigorously when budded on a strong and congenial
      stock. On the other hand, the very existence of a budded rose is, in our
      severe climate, precarious. A hard winter may kill it down to the point of
      inoculation, and it is then lost past recovery; whereas a rose on its own
      roots may be killed to the level of the earth, and yet throw up vigorous
      shoots in the spring. Moreover, a budded rose requires more attention than
      the cultivator is always willing to bestow on it. An ill-informed or
      careless amateur will suffer shoots to grow from the roots or stem of the
      stock; and, as these are always vigorous, they engross all the
      nourishment, and leave the budded rose to dwindle or die; while its
      disappointed owner, ignorant of the true condition of things, often
      congratulates himself on the prosperous growth of his plant. At length he
      is undeceived by the opening of the buds, and the appearance of a host of
      insignificant single roses in the place of the Giant of Battles or General
      Jacqueminot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Budding, however, cannot be dispensed with, since, in losing it, we should
      lose the most effectual means of increasing and distributing the choicest
      roses. The process consists in implanting, as it were, an undeveloped
      leaf-bud, of the variety we wish to increase, in the bark and wood of some
      other species of rose. The latter is called the stock, and it should be of
      a hardy and vigorous nature. Two conditions are essential to the process.
      The first is, that the bark of the stock will "slip;" in other words,
      separate freely from the wood. The second is, that the rose to be
      increased should be furnished with young and sound leaf-buds in a dormant
      state. These conditions are best answered in summer and early autumn, from
      the first of July to the middle of September. During the whole of this
      period, the sap being in active motion, the bark separates freely from the
      wood, while there is always a supply of plump and healthy buds on shoots
      of the same year's growth. The only implement necessary is a
      budding-knife. The operator should also provide himself with strings of
      bass-matting, moistened to make them pliant. Instead of the bass,
      cotton-wicking is occasionally used. Cut well-ripened shoots of the
      variety to be increased, provided with plump and healthy buds. In order to
      prevent exhaustion by evaporation from the surface of the leaves, these
      should be at once cut off; leaving, however, about half an inch of the
      leaf-stalk still attached to the stem. Insert the knife in the bark of the
      stem half an inch above a bud, and then pass it smoothly downward to the
      distance of half an inch below the bud, thus removing the latter with a
      strip of bark attached. A small portion of the wood will also adhere. This
      may be removed; though this is not necessary, and is attended with some
      little risk of pulling out with it the eye, or vital part, of the bud. Now
      place the bud between the lips while you take the next step of the
      process. This consists in cutting a vertical, slit in the bark of the
      stock. This done, cut a tranverse slit across the top of the vertical one.
      Both should be quite through the bark to the wood below; then, with the
      flat handle of the budding-knife, raise the corners of the bark, and
      disengage it from the wood sufficiently to allow of the bud being slipped
      smoothly into the crevice between the wood and bark of the stock. Next
      apply the edge of the knife to the protruding end of the bark attached to
      the bud, and cut it smoothly off immediately over the tranverse slit in
      the bark of the stock. The bud is now adjusted accurately in its place,
      the overlapping bark closing neatly around it. Now tie it above and below
      pretty firmly with repeated turns of the bass-matting, and the work is
      done. It must be remembered, that, to be well done, it must be quickly
      done; and it is better to insert the bud on the north or shady side of the
      stock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bud and the stock will soon begin to grow together. After a week or
      two they should be examined, and the tie loosened. If the bud is put in
      early in the season, it may be made to grow almost immediately by cutting
      off the ends of the growing shoots of the stock, and thus forcing sap
      towards the bud. As the bud grows, the stock should be still further
      shortened, and all the shoots growing below the bud should be removed
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Budded stocks require in this country, at least when the buds are dormant,
      a protection against the winter. Where there are but few, oiled paper, or
      something of' a similar nature, may be tied over the bud as a shelter from
      snow, rain, and sun; but, when there are many, this is impossible, and the
      stocks may be taken up, and "heeled" close together in a dry soil under a
      shelter of boards and mats. "Heeling" is merely a temporary planting.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following spring, the stocks may be cut off to within an inch of
      the bud, and then planted where they are to remain. When the bud is
      inserted near the ground,&mdash;which in our climate should always be
      done,&mdash;the stock should be planted in such a manner that the bud is a
      little below the level of the earth. To this end, the stock should be set
      in a slanting position in the hole dug for it; the bud, of course, being
      uppermost, and about an inch below the level of the edge of the hole: then
      the hole should be partially filled in. When the bud has grown out to the
      height of six or eight inches, the hole may be filled altogether. No part
      of the stock will now be seen above the earth. By this means, the point of
      junction of the stock and the bud is protected from the cold of winter and
      the heat of summer, and the rose will live longer and thrive better than
      where the stock is exposed. In many cases, the rose will throw out roots
      of its own above its junction with the stock, and thus become in time a
      self-rooted plant.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are two kinds of stocks in common use at the present time for
      out-door roses. One is the Dog Rose, a variety growing wild in various
      parts of Europe; the other is the Manetti Rose, a seedling raised by the
      Italian cultivator whose name it bears. There can be no doubt, that, of
      the two, the Manetti is by far the better for this climate. It is very
      vigorous, very hardy, easily increased by layers or cuttings of the ripe
      wood, and free from the vicious habit of the Dog Rose, of throwing out
      long under-ground suckers. We would by no means say that it will not throw
      up an abundance of shoots from the roots if allowed to do so; but these
      shoots are easily distinguished by a practised eye from those of the
      budded rose. They may be known at a glance by the peculiar reddish tint of
      the stem, and by the shape and the deep glossy hue of the leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      They must be removed as soon as seen, not by cutting them off, but by
      tearing them off under ground, either by hand if possible, or with the
      help of a forked stick, which, pressed strongly into the earth, slips them
      off at their junction with the root.
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be denied that many kinds of roses, budded low on the Manetti
      stock, will grow with a vigor, and bloom with a splendor, which they do
      not reach on their own roots, and which will often repay the additional
      labor which they exact. We once planted in the manner above described a
      strong Manetti stock containing a single bud of the Hybrid Perpetual Hose,&mdash;-Triomphe
      de l'Exposition. In the September following, it had thrown up a stem with
      several branches, the central shoot rising to the height of six feet and a
      half, and bearing on its top the largest and finest blossom we have ever
      seen of that superb variety. Some roses, however, will not grow well on
      the Manetti. Others, again, can scarcely be grown with advantage in any
      other way, refusing to strike root from layers, and often failing when the
      attempt is made to root them from cuttings even of the soft wood. Some,
      even when rooted, remain feeble and dwarfish plants; while, if a bud from
      them is implanted in a good Manetti stock, it would grow to a vigorous
      bush in one season. To sum up, we would say, that, for the amateur, nine
      roses out of ten are better on their own roots, while there are a few
      which can only be grown successfully, budded on a good stock.

    <p>
      All the evil that can be spoken of budded roses is doubly true of grafted
      roses; while the advantages which the former can claim are possessed in a
      less degree by the latter. The reason is, simply, that, in the case of the
      budded rose, the junction between the stock and foreign variety is
      commonly more perfect than in the case of the grafted rose. Indeed, it
      would not be worth while to graft roses at all, were it not for the fact
      that grafting can be practised at times when budding is impossible. This
      is because it is indispensable, in budding, that the sap of the stock
      should be in full motion; whereas, in grafting, it may be at rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are innumerable modes of grafting; but, for the rose, the simplest
      form of what is called "whip-grafting" is perhaps the best. In the end of
      winter, or at the beginning of spring, take young well-rooted plants of
      the Ma-netti stock, having stems not much larger than a quill. Beginning
      very near the root, shave off with a sharp knife a slip of the bark, with
      a little of the wood, to the length of something more than an inch; then
      shave down the lower end of the graft until it fits accurately the part of
      the stock whence the bark and wood have been pared off. The essential
      point is, that the inner bark of the graft should be in contact with the
      inner bark of the stock. When the two are fitted, bind them around with
      strings of wet bass-matting. Now plant the stock in a pot, setting it so
      deeply, that its point of junction with the graft is completely covered
      with soil. Place the pots thus prepared on a gentle hot-bed, and cover
      them closely with glass. When the shoots from the graft are well grown
      out, give them air by degrees to harden them.
    </p>
    <p>
      A better way is to pot the stocks early in autumn, so that they may become
      well established. In this case, it will be necessary to cover the junction
      of the stock and graft with grafting wax or clay in such a manner as to
      exclude all air; then plunge the pots in old tan over a gentle hot-bed, so
      deeply that the grafted part is completely covered, the ends only of the
      grafts being visible. This keeps them in an equable heat and moisture. The
      subsequent treatment is the same as in the former case. As the stock has
      acquired a hold on the earth of the pot, or is, as the gardeners express
      it, "established," the graft will grow much more quickly, and make a
      strong blooming plant the same season.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all grafting, whether of roses or other woody plants, it is necessary
      that the buds of the graft should be completely dormant. In the stock, on
      the other hand, a slight and partial awakening of the vital action at the
      time the graft is put on seems rather beneficial than injurious.

      In this mode of increasing roses, Nature, rather than the cultivator, may
      be said to do the work of propagation. Many sorts of roses throw out
      spontaneously long underground stems, from which roots soon issue, and
      which soon throw up an abundance of shoots above ground. When these
      suckers, as they are called, are separated from the parent, and planted
      apart, they make a strong growth, but rarely form plants so symmetrical as
      those raised from cuttings or layers.

      CHAPTER IV. MISCELLANEOUS OPERATIONS

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>AISING NEW
      VARIETIES.&mdash;A layer, a cutting, a bud, a graft, and a sucker, are
      detached portions of an individual plant; and the plant resulting from
      them is of precisely the same character with the parent. But, when the
      seed germinates, it is not the reproduction of the same individual, but it
      is the birth of a new one. The offspring will show a family likeness; but
      it is by no means probable, at least in the case of the rose, that its
      features will be precisely the same with those of its parent. Plant the
      seeds of a rose; as, for example, of the Hybrid Perpetual, La Reine, and
      of the resulting seedlings: all will probably show traces, more or less,
      of their origin; but the greater part will be far inferior to the parent.
      Some will be single; many will be half double; and, among a large number
      of seedlings, we shall be fortunate if we find two or three equal in
      beauty to La Reine herself. Nor is it at all likely that even these will
      be her precise counterparts. They may possibly be her equals; but they
      will not exactly resemble her: and thus we obtain a new and valuable
      acquisition to the list of roses. Now, if, instead of singly gathering and
      sowing the seeds of La Reine, we first impregnate its flowers with the
      pollen of a different variety, such as the Giant of Battles, our chance of
      a valuable result is increased, because, if we are fortunate, we combine
      the desirable qualities of two sorts. It is not impossible that we may
      thus produce a rose combining the vigorous growth and large globular
      flowers of La Reine with some portion of the vivid coloring of the Giant
      of Battles. It is by the raising of seedlings with or without
      hybridization that the innumerable roses that decorate our gardens and
      fill the catalogues of nursery-men have been produced. M. Laffay, to whom
      more than to any other single cultivator we are indebted for bringing into
      existence the splendid family of the Hybrid Perpetual roses, raised in one
      year more than three hundred thousand seedlings. Of these, all but a small
      portion were, no doubt, pulled up, and thrown away as worthless, after
      their first blooming; the rest were allowed to stand for further trial:
      and if, finally, a score or two of roses really distinct and valuable were
      obtained, the year's culture may have been regarded as a great success. It
      requires a long time before the character of a seedling-rose can be
      thoroughly ascertained. M. Margottin, another eminent rose-grower, says
      that no conscientious cultivator will permit a seedling to pass out of his
      hands until lie has given it a six-years' trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raising of roses from seed is an occupation of so much interest, that
      few who have fairly entered upon it have ever willingly abandoned it. Many
      choice roses have been raised by amateurs; and those who have the time and
      means to enter on a large or a small scale upon this pursuit will find it
      a source of abundant enjoyment. In the next chapter, we shall point out
      the combinations from which the existing classes of Hybrid roses have
      sprung; and hereafter, when we come to the description of these classes,
      we shall add a few suggestions as to other combinations likely to produce
      good results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some roses bear seed freely, while others can hardly be induced to bear it
      at all. The hybridizer should take note of their peculiarities in this
      respect, or he will throw away much labor and patience; for it is a
      thankless task to hybridize a rose, which, after all the labor spent upon
      it, will not produce a single seed-vessel. Fortunately, many of the best
      roses bear seed abundantly; and La Reine, General Jacqueminot, Jules
      Margottin, Madame Laffay, and many others as good as these, may
      confidently be relied on. It is a good rule, that no seedling-rose is
      worth preserving, or at least worth propagating, that is not, in some one
      point, superior to or distinct from any other rose existing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roses should be hybridized immediately after they open, or they will
      become thoroughly fertilized with their own pollen, and the object of the
      operation will thus be defeated. The best time of the day is about ten
      o'clock in the morning, as soon as the sun has dried the dew from the
      centre of the flower. The pollen of the rose whose qualities it is wished
      to impart may be applied to the pistils of the maternal or seed-bearing
      flower with a camel's-hair pencil; or one rose may be held over the other,
      and tapped with the finger till the pollen falls upon the pistils of the
      seed-bearer. Roses are uncertain as to the production of pollen. In some
      seasons and some situations it is abundant, while in others it is produced
      very scantily. The impregnated roses may be marked by strings or labels
      tied to their stems. The seed should not be gathered till the first frost;
      and, to insure its ripening, the plant should stand in a warm, sunny
      exposure. The pods should be laid in the sun to dry, then broken up, and
      the seed separated by means of a sieve.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found the following mode of sowing a successful one: A frame&mdash;a
      shallow hot-bed frame answers perfectly&mdash;should be prepared by making
      within it a bed of loam, old manure, leaf-mould, and sand, at least
      eighteen inches deep. These materials should be thoroughly mixed, and the
      surface layer for an inch or two in depth sifted through a moderately
      coarse sieve, and then levelled and smoothed. The seeds may be sown
      broadcast; that is to say, scattered over the surface. They may be sown
      thickly, as not a third part will germinate; and, when sown, they should
      be pressed firmly into the soil with a board or the back of a spade. Then
      the same soil should be sifted over them to the depth of half an inch, and
      pressed down very lightly. Some will prefer to sow them in drills, which
      should be about six inches apart; the seed in no case being more than half
      an inch deep. Now leave the frame open, and exposed to rain and frost.
      Just before the heavy snows begin, and when the whole is hard frozen,
      cover it with boards and mats, that it may remain frozen till spring. The
      object of this is to protect the seeds from mice, which are exceedingly
      fond of them. When the mild weather begins, open the frame, and allow the
      ground to thaw: keeping, however, a close watch upon them; for, though
      these depredators like to do their work under cover and in darkness, there
      is still some little danger of their attacks. As the soil warms, the seeds
      will begin to come up. Some of the ever-blooming roses may blossom the
      first season; but the Hardy June kinds will not show bloom before the
      third, or even the fourth year. If the plants are too crowded, pull up
      some of them when the ground is softened after a rain, and plant them in a
      bed by themselves. In the autumn, take them all up, and heel them in a
      mouse-proof frame for safe keeping through the winter. In the spring,
      plant them out in rich soil, a foot apart. They might, indeed, be wintered
      safely in the frame where they originally grew: but this is attended with
      one disadvantage; for many of the seeds will not germinate till the second
      year; and, in removing the plants at that time, these infant seedlings
      would be destroyed; whereas, by leaving them undisturbed, a second crop
      may be obtained. Care must be taken throughout to keep the frame free from
      weeds.
    </p>

      The eminent English rose-grower, Mr. Rivers, recommends a method of
      raising seedlings, which we have not tried, but which we have no doubt is
      a good one, though not applicable to raising them on a large scale. We
      give his directions in his own words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The hips of all the varieties of roses will, in general, be fully ripe by
      the beginning of November: they should then be gathered, and kept entire
      in a flower-pot filled with dry sand, carefully guarded from mice. In
      February, or by the first week in March, they must be broken to pieces
      with the fingers, and sown in flower-pots, such as are generally used for
      sowing seeds in, called 'seed-pans;' but, for rose-seeds, they should not
      be too shallow: nine inches in depth will be enough. These should be
      nearly, but not quite, filled with a rich compost of rotten manure, and
      sandy loam or peat. The seeds may be covered to the depth of about half an
      inch with the same compost. A piece of kiln-wire must then be placed over
      the pot, fitting closely at the rim, so as to prevent the ingress of mice,
      which are passionately fond of rose-seeds. There must be space enough
      between the wire and the mould for the young plants to come up: half an
      inch will probably be found enough. The pots of seed must never be placed
      under glass, but kept constantly in the open air, in a full sunny
      exposure, as the wire will shade the mould, and prevent its drying. Water
      should be given occasionally in dry weather. The young plants will perhaps
      make their appearance in April or May; but very often the seed will not
      vegetate till the second spring. When they have made their 'rough leaves,'
      that is, when they have three or four leaves, exclusive of their
      seed-leaves, they must be carefully raised with the point of a narrow
      priming-knife, potted into small pots, and placed in the shade: if the
      weather be very hot and dry, they may be covered with a hand-glass for a
      few days. They may remain in those pots a month, and then be planted out
      into a rich border: by the end of August, those that are robust growers
      will have made shoots long enough to take buds from. Those that have done
      so may be cut down, and one or two strong stocks budded with each: these
      will, the following summer, make vigorous shoots; and the summer
      following, if left unpruned, to a certainty they will produce flowers.
      This is the only method to insure seedling roses flowering the third year:
      many will do so that are not budded; but very often the superior varieties
      are shy bloomers on their own roots, till age and careful culture give
      them strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It may be mentioned here, as treatment applicable to all seed-bearing
      roses, that, when it is desirable the qualities of a favorite rose should
      preponderate, the petals of the flower to be fertilized must be opened
      gently with the fingers. * A flower that will expand in the morning should
      be opened the afternoon or evening previous, and the anthers all removed
      with a pair of pointed scissors: the following morning, when this flower
      is fully expanded, it must be fertilized with a flower of some variety, of
      which it is desired to have seedlings partaking largely of its qualities.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * "It requires some watchfulness to do this at the proper
     time: if too soon, the petals will be injured in forcing
     them open; and in hot weather, in July, if delayed only an
     hour or two, the anthers will be found to have shed their
     pollen. To ascertain precisely when the pollen is in a fit
     state for transmission, a few of the anthers should be
     gently pressed with the finger and thumb: if the yellow dust
     adheres to them, the operation may be performed. It requires
     close examination and some practice to know when the flower
     to be operated upon is in a fit state to receive the pollen:
     as a general rule, the flowers ought to be in the same state
     of expansion; or, in other words, about the same age. It is
     only in cases where it is wished for the qualities of a
     particular rose to predominate that the removal of the
     anthers of the rose to be fertilized is necessary: thus, if
     a yellow climbing rose is desired by the union of the Yellow
     Brier with the Ayrshire, 'every anther should be removed
     from the latter, so that it is fertilized solely with the
     pollen of the former. In some cases, where it is desirable
     to have the qualities of both parents in an equal degree,
     the removal of the anthers need not take place: thus I have
     found by removing them from the Luxembourg Moss, and
     fertilizing that rose with a dark variety of Rosa Galliea,
     that the features of the Moss Rose are totally lost in its
     offspring, and they become nearly pure varieties of Rosa
     Galliea; but if the anthers of the Moss Rose are left
     untouched, and it is fertilized with Rosa Galliea,
     interesting hybrids are the result, more or less mossy. This
     seems to make superfetation very probable; yet Dr. Lindley,
     in 'Theory of Horticulture' p.332, 'thinks it is not very
     likely to occur.'"
</pre>
    <p>
      To exemplify this, we will suppose that a climbing Moss Rose with red or
      crimson flowers is wished for. The flowers of the Blush Ayrshire, which
      bears seed abundantly, may be selected, and, before expansion, the anthers
      removed. The following morning, or as soon after the operation as these
      flowers open, they should be fertilized with those of the Luxembourg Moss.
      If the operation succeed, seeds will be procured, from which the
      probability is that a climbing rose will be produced with the habit and
      flowers of the Moss Rose, or at least an approximation to them; and as
      these hybrids often bear seed freely, by repeating the process with them,
      the at present apparent remote chance of getting a climbing Moss Rose may
      be brought very near.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I mention the union of the Moss and Ayrshire roses by way of
      illustration, and merely to point out to the amateur how extensive and how
      interesting a field of operations is open in this way. I ought to give a
      fact that has occurred in my own experience, which will tell better with
      the sceptical than a thousand anticipations. About four years since, in a
      pan of seedling Moss roses was one with a most peculiar habit, even when
      very young: this has since proved a hybrid rose, partaking much more of
      the Scotch Rose than of any other, and, till the plant arrived at full
      growth, I thought it a Scotch rose, the seed of which had by accident been
      mixed with that of the Moss Rose, although I had taken extreme care. To my
      surprise, it has since proved a perfect hybrid, having the sepals and the
      fruit of the Provence Rose, with the spiny and dwarf habit of the Scotch
      Rose: it bears abundance of hips, which are all abortive. * The difference
      in the fruit of the Moss and Provence roses and that of the Scotch is very
      remarkable, and this it was which drew my particular attention to the
      plant in question.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * "It is more than probable, that, if the flowers of this
     rose were fertilized with those of the single Moss Hose,
     they would produce seed from which some curious hybrid Moss
     roses might be expected."
</pre>
    <p>
      It was raised from the same seed and in the same seed-pan as the Single
      Crimson Moss Rose. As this strange hybrid came from a Moss Rose,
      accidentally fertilized, we may expect that art will do much more for us."

      Some of the more hardy kinds of climbing roses, as, for example, the Queen
      of the Prairies, may be induced to wear borrowed robes, and assume
      beauties beyond those with which Nature endowed them. At the proper
      season, they may be budded here and there with some of the most hardy and
      vigorous of the June and Hybrid Perpetual roses. As these varieties bloom
      earlier than the Prairie roses, the period of bloom of the climber will be
      greatly protracted by this process, while at the same time it will be made
      to bear flowers incomparably finer in form and color than its own. It will
      be necessary, however, in our Northern climate, to protect it by nailing
      mats over it, since otherwise many of the buds will be winter-killed; and,
      as it is expected to yield more than its natural share of bloom, it should
      be stimulated with more than the usual manuring, and pruned more closely
      than the ordinary climbing roses.

      We have before spoken of the difficulty of cultivating standard roses, or
      roses budded on tall stems, in our climate. It is possible, however, to
      produce a kind of standard without a resort to budding. We may choose some
      of the most hardy and vigorous of the June roses,&mdash;we may find such
      especially in the class known as the Hybrid Chinas,&mdash;and encourage
      the growth of a single, strong, upright stem, removing all other shoots
      from the base of the plant as fast as they appear. The stem should be kept
      straight by tying it to a stick till it has gained strength enough to hold
      itself erect. Thus, in a single season, we shall have, with some
      varieties, a stem five or six feet high. Early in spring, prune it down to
      the first healthy and plump bud. During the following season, allow no
      shoots to develop themselves, except at the top; and, in the succeeding
      spring, prune back these top-shoots to two or three eyes. All of these
      eyes will, in their turn, develop into shoots; and these, again, are to be
      pruned back like the first. Thus, in two or three seasons, we obtain a
      thick bushy head at the top of a tall upright stem; in short, a standard,
      capable of bearing even a New-England winter.

      It is always better to prepare beds for roses in the autumn, that they may
      have the benefit of a thorough exposure to the winter frost. With this
      view, the soil should be thrown up into ridges as roughly as possible. It
      will then be thoroughly frozen through, and subjected to all the changes
      of temperature during the season. This will not only tend to destroy worms
      and noxious insects, but it will separate the particles of the soil, and
      leave it light and pliable. Soil thrown into ridges can also be worked
      earlier in the spring than that which is left at its natural level.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cardinal points of successful rose-culture are a good soil, good
      pruning, and good cultivation. By cultivation, we mean a repeated digging,
      hoeing, or forking of the earth around the plants, by which the surface is
      kept open, and enabled freely to receive the dew, rain, and air, with its
      fertilizing gases. Plants so treated will suffer far less in a drought
      than if the soil had been left undisturbed; for not only will it now
      absorb the dew at night, but it will freely permit the moisture which
      always exists at certain depths below the surface to rise, and benefit the
      thirsty roots. For a similar reason, the process of subsoiling, or
      trenching, by which the earth is loosened and stirred to a great depth, is
      exceedingly beneficial to roses, since the lower portions of the disturbed
      soil are a magazine of moisture which the severest drought cannot exhaust.
    </p>
    <p>
      With newly-planted roses it is well to practise "mulching" with manure;
      or, in other words, to place manure on the surface around the roots of the
      plants. This keeps the ground moist and open, while every rain washes down
      a portion of nutriment to the roots.

      Roses may be planted in clumps, on the lawn, with far better effect than
      when arranged in formal beds. They may be separated according to their
      classes, as June roses, Bourbons, Hybrid Perpétuals, Mosses, &amp;c.; and
      the effect will be vastly better, if, instead of mingling colors
      indiscriminately, each is placed by itself. Thus the pure white of Madame
      Plantier will form a rich contrast with the deep crimson of General
      Jacqueminot, the vivid rose of Jules Margottin, the clear flesh-color of
      Ville de Bruxelles, and the pale rose of Baronne Prévost, each massed by
      itself; while all these varied hues are beautifully relieved by the fresh
      green of a well-kept lawn with its surrounding trees and shrubbery.

      CHAPTER V. GROUPS and FAMILIES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>IKE ALL things
      living, in the world of mind or of matter, the rose is beautified,
      enlarged, and strengthened by a course of judicious and persevering
      culture, continued through successive generations. The art of horticulture
      is no leveller. Its triumphs are achieved by rigid systems of selection
      and rejection, founded always on the broad basis of intrinsic worth. The
      good cultivator propagates no plants but the best. He carefully chooses
      those marked out by conspicuous merit; protects them from the pollen of
      inferior sorts; intermarries them, perhaps, with other varieties of equal
      vigor and beauty; saves their seed, and raises from it another generation.
      From the new plants thus obtained he again chooses the best, and repeats
      with them the same process. Thus the rose and other plants are brought
      slowly to their perfect development. It is in vain to look for much
      improvement by merely cultivating one individual. Culture alone will not
      make a single rose double, or a dull rose brilliant. We cultivate the
      parent, and look for our reward in the offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The village maiden has a beauty and a charm of her own; and so has her
      counterpart in the floral world,&mdash;the wild rose that grows by the
      roadside. Transplanted to the garden, and, with its offspring after it to
      the fourth and fifth generation, made an object of skilful culture, it
      reaches at last a wonderful development. The flowers which in the
      ancestress were single and small become double in the offspring, and
      expand their countless petals to the sun in all the majesty of the Queen
      of Flowers. The village maid has risen to regal state. She has lost her
      native virgin charm; but she sits throned and crowned in imperial beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, all the roses of our gardens have some wild ancestress of the woods
      and meadows, from whom, in the process of successive generations, their
      beauties have been developed, sometimes by happy accidents, but oftener by
      design. Thus have arisen families of roses, each marked with traces of its
      parentage. These are the patricians of the floral commonwealth, gifted at
      once with fame, beauty, and rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      The various wild roses differ greatly in their capacity of improvement and
      development. In some cases, the offspring grow rapidly, in color, fulness,
      and size, with every successive generation. In other cases, they will not
      improve at all; and the rose remains a wild rose still, good only for the
      roadside. With others yet, there seems to be a fixed limit, which is soon
      reached, and where improvement stops. It requires, even with the best,
      good culture and selection through several generations before the highest
      result appears. In horticulture, an element of stability is essential to
      progress. When the florist sees in any rose a quality which he wishes to
      develop and perfect, he does not look for success to the plant before him,
      but to the offspring which he produces from this plant. 'But this
      production and culture must be conducted 'wisely and skilfully, or the
      offspring will degenerate instead of improving.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are different kinds of culture, with different effects. That which
      is founded in the laws of Nature, and aims at a universal development,
      produces for its result not only increased beauty, but increased symmetry,
      strength, and vitality. On the other hand, it is in the power of the
      skilful florist to develop or to repress whatever quality he may please.
      By artificial processes of culture, roses have been produced, beautiful in
      form and color, but so small, that the whole plant, it is said, might be
      covered with an egg-shell. These are results of the ingenious florists of
      China and Japan. The culture that refines without invigorating, belongs,
      it seems, to a partial or perverted civilization.
    </p>
    <p>
      These several families of roses, resulting from the development of the
      several species of wild rose, have mingled together; in other words, they
      have intermarried: for Linnaeus has shown that "the loves of the flowers"
      are more than a conceit of poetical fancy. From the fertilization of the
      flowers of a rose of one family with the pollen of a rose of another
      family arises a mixed offspring, called <i>hybrids</i>: Seeds&mdash;which
      are vegetable eggs&mdash;are first produced; and these seeds germinate, or
      hatch, into a brood of young plants, combining in some degree the
      qualities of their parents. As this process of intermixture may be carried
      on indefinitely, a vast number of new varieties has resulted from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The botanical classification of the rose is a perplexity to botanists. Its
      garden classification&mdash;quite another matter&mdash;is no less a source
      of embarrassment to its amateur, not to say professional, cultivator. To
      many, indeed, its entire nomenclature is a labyrinth of confusion; and
      some have gone to the length of proposing to abolish distinctions, which,
      in their eyes, seem arbitrary or fanciful. These distinctions, however,
      are founded in Nature, though the superstructure built upon her is
      sometimes flimsy enough to justify the impatience of its assailants. The
      chief difficulty arises from the extent to which the hybridization of the
      rose has been carried, and the vast entanglement of combinations which has
      resulted. Out of a propensity to classify, where, in the nature of things,
      precise classification is impossible, has arisen the equivocal and shadowy
      character of many of the nominal distinctions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Omitting less important divisions, the following are the groups into which
      cultivated roses are ordinarily divided: The Provence,* the Moss,* the
      French,* the Hybrid China, the Damask,* the Alba,* the Austrian Brier,*
      the Sweet-brier,* the Scotch,* the Double Yellow,* the Ayrshire,* the
      Sempervirens,* the Multiflora,* the Boursault,* the Banksia,* the
      Prairie.* These bloom once in the season. The following are perpetual or
      <i>remontant</i>: The China,* the Tea,* the Bourbon, the Hybrid Perpetual,
      the Perpetual Moss, the Damask Perpetual,* the Noisette, the Musk,* the
      Macartney,* the Microphylla.*
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the above are marked with a star*: these are roses of <i>pure
      blood</i>. The rest are roses of mixed or hybrid origin. By the former are
      meant those which have sprung, without intermixture, from the wild roses
      which grew naturally in various parts of the world, and which are the only
      roses of which the botanical classifier takes cognizance. Many of them are
      of great beauty, and would be highly prized for ornamental uses, were they
      not eclipsed by the more splendid double varieties, which the industry of
      the florist has developed from them. Each of these groups of unmixed
      roses, however modified in form, size, or color, retains, as already
      mentioned, distinctive features of the native type from which it sprang.
      Yet it often happens that the name is misapplied. Thus a rose called
      Damask is not always a Damask, but a hybrid between a Damask and some
      other variety. The true distinctive features of the group are thus
      rendered, in some nominal members of it, so faint, that they can scarcely
      be recognized. Leaving these bastards out of view, we will consider at
      present only the legitimate offspring of the various families of the rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Mount Caucasus grows a single wild rose, from the seeds of which have
      sprung the numerous family of the Provence or Cabbage roses, very double,
      very large, and very fragrant. This race is remarkable for its tendency to
      sport, from which have resulted some of the most singular and beautiful
      forms of the rose. For example, a rose-colored variety of the Provence
      produced a branch bearing striped flowers, and from that branch has been
      propagated the Striped Provence. The Crested Moss is the product of
      another of these freaks, being of the pure Provence race. The Common Moss,
      and all its progeny, have the same origin; being derived, in all
      probability, from a sporting branch of one of the Provence roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family of the French-Rose, or Rosa Gallica, is of vast extent, and,
      though including many diverse shades of color,&mdash;some pale, some
      bright, others spotted, striped, or marbled,&mdash;is commonly recognized
      without much difficulty by its family features. It is a native of Southern
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wild progenitor of the Damask or Damascus roses is a native of Syria.
      The name <i>Damask</i>, by the way, is popularly applied to deep-colored
      roses in general; but its floral signification is very different. In this
      group, for the first time, we meet with a feature, which, desirable as it
      is, was not many years since regarded as rare and exceptional. June has
      always been regarded as the month of the rose; but some of the Damasks
      have the peculiarity of blooming twice, or more than twice, during the
      season. These have been placed in a group by themselves, and christened
      Damask Perpétuais. The remontant character, however, is not confined to
      them; for individual plants belonging to groups and varieties which
      usually bloom but once will sometimes display an autumnal bloom. Thus the
      common wild rose of New England is now and then to be seen covered with
      flowers in September; and there is little doubt, that, from the seeds of
      these twice-blooming individuals, a new race of hardy <i>remontant</i>
      roses might be produced. It should be added, that many of the so-called
      Damask Perpetuals are not pure Damask, but crossed with the blood of other
      families.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the remaining races of pure blood, the Alba is remarkable for the
      delicate coloring of its flowers; the greater part being, as the name
      imports, white, or nearly so. The original variety grows wild in Central
      Europe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Austrian Brier is another family, of features very strongly marked.
      Yellow and copper are its prevailing colors; and from its habit of growth,
      and the color of its twigs, it is easily recognized under all its forms.
      Its original types are natives of the south of Europe, and probably of
      Persia; to which country we owe its finest development,&mdash;the
      well-known Persian Yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Double Yellow Rose, Rosa Sulphurea, remarkable for its beauty, and, in
      our climate, notorious for its intractable and uncertain character, is
      regarded by some botanists as belonging to a group distinct from the
      preceding. The Single Yellow, from which it must have sprung, has been
      found wild in the north of India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Sweet-brier, found wild in various parts of the world, is too well
      known to need further notice. The American variety differs distinctly from
      the European.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Scotch roses owe their origin to the dwarf wild rose of Scotland. The
      Ayrshire is a family of climbing roses, originating from the wild trailing
      rose, Rosa Arven-sis, common in the British islands. The best of them are
      said, however, to be hybrids between this rose' and other species. The
      Boursault roses are descendants of Rosa Alpina, a native of the Alps; and
      no family is more clearly marked by distinctive features. The Sempervirens
      and the Multiflora are, with us at least, less familiar. Both are
      climbers, like the former; the one originating from a wild rose of Italy,
      the other from a wild rose of Japan. The Banksia, with its smooth, shining
      leaves, and slender, green stems, is well known in every greenhouse. Its
      progenitor is a native of China or Tartary, and the improved varieties are
      chiefly due to the labors of Chinese florists.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another race of climbers, held in great scorn by foreign
      florists, but admirably adapted to our climate, under whose influences
      they put forth beauties by no means contemptible. These are the progeny of
      the wild Michigan or Prairie Rose, rampant growers, and generally sturdy
      enough to outface our hardest winters. The best of them, however, the
      Baltimore Belle, is evidently the offspring of a foreign marriage, which,
      while contributing fragrance and beauty to the rugged race of the
      prairies, has detracted something from its hardihood. The union, probably
      accidental, seems to have been with the Tea Rose or the Noisette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the foregoing groups, all except the Damask Perpetual are
      once-blooming. The following have, to a greater or less extent, the
      desirable character of a continued or successive bloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macartney Rose is a wild rose of China, from which a few improved
      varieties have been raised from seed. Its evergreen shining foliage is its
      most attractive feature. The Microphylla, or Small-leaved Rose, is closely
      akin to the Macartney, and, like the latter, is a native of the East.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Musk is a rose much more familiarly known. It descends from a Persian
      or Syrian progenitor, and its vigorous growth, rich clusters of bloom, and
      peculiar fragrance, have long made it a favorite. But by far the most
      interesting and valuable among the unmixed races of ever-blooming roses
      are the numberless offspring of Rosa Indica, in its several varieties. To
      it we owe all the China and Tea-scented roses, while to its foreign
      alliances we are indebted for a vast and increasing host of brilliant
      hybrids.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, from the families of pure blood, we come at length to those in which
      is mingled that of two or more distinct races. Convey the pollen of a
      China rose to the stigmas of a French, Damask, or Provence rose, and from
      the resulting seed an offspring arises different from either parent. Hence
      a new group of roses known as the Hybrid Chinas. The parents are both of
      moderate growth. The offspring is usually of such vigor as to form with
      readiness a pillar eight feet high. Its foliage is distinct, its bloom
      often as profuse and brilliant as that of the China, and its constitution
      as hardy, or nearly so, as that of the French Rose. Unlike the former, it
      blooms but once in the year, or only in a few exceptional instances shows
      a straggling autumnal flower. By a vicious system of subdivision, the
      group has been separated into Hybrid China, Hybrid Bourbon, and Hybrid
      Noisette. The two latter are the same as the first: except, in the one
      case, a slight infusion of the Damask Perpetual; and, in the latter, of
      the Musk Rose. In many cases, no human discernment could detect the
      effects of the admixture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: convey the pollen of the China or Tea Rose to the flowers of the
      Musk, or <i>vice versa</i> and for a result we obtain the Noisette,
      inheriting from the former various striking characteristics of foliage and
      bloom, and from the latter its vigorous climbing habit and clustering
      inflorescence. But, by impregnation through several generations, some of
      the Noisettes retain so little of their Musk parent, that its traits are
      almost obliterated: they no longer bloom in clusters, and can scarcely be
      distinguished from the pure Tea Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again: a union of a Damask Perpetual with a China rose has produced a
      distinct race, of vigorous habit and peculiar foliage, possessing in a
      high degree the ever-blooming character of both its parents. It is hardier
      than the China Rose, though usually unable to bear a New-England winter
      unprotected. This is the Bourbon Rose, a brilliant and beautiful group,
      worth all the care which in this latitude its out-door culture requires.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Moss Rose, impregnated with various ever-blooming varieties, has borne
      hybrids partially retaining the mossy stem and calyx, with a tendency more
      or less manifest to bloom in the autumn. Hence the group of the Perpetual
      Moss, a few only of whose members deserve the name.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident, that, by continuing the process of hybridizing, hybrids may
      be mixed with hybrids, till the blood of half a score of the original
      races is mingled in one plant. This, in some cases, is, without doubt,
      actually the case; and this bastard progeny must, of necessity, be
      classified rather by its visible characteristics than by its parentage.
      Thus a host of ever-blooming hybrids, which are neither Noisette nor
      Bourbon nor Perpetual Moss, have been cast into one grand group, under the
      comprehensive title of Hybrid Perpetuals. Whence have they sprung? What
      has been their parentage? The question is easier asked than answered: for
      as, in a great nation of the West, one may discern the lineaments and hear
      the accents of diverse commingled races; so here we may trace the features
      of many and various families of Indian or Siberian, Chinese or European,
      extraction. The Hybrid Perpetuals, however, inherit their <i>remontant</i>
      character chiefly from Rosa Indica,&mdash;the China or Tea Rose,&mdash;and,
      in a far less degree, from the Damask Perpetual. An infusion of the former
      exists, in greater or less degree, in all of them; while the blood of the
      Damask Perpetual shows its traces in comparatively few. Many of the group
      are the results of a union between the Hybrid China roses and some variety
      of the China or Tea. Others owe their origin to the Hybrid China and the
      Bourbon, both parents being hybrids of Rosa Indica. Others are offspring
      of the Hybrid China crossed with the Damask Perpetual; while many spring
      from intermarriages within the group itself,&mdash;Hybrid Perpetual with
      Hybrid Perpetual.
    </p>
    <p>
      By some over-zealous classifiers, this group has been cut up into various
      subdivisions, as Bourbon Perpetual, Rose de Rosomène, and the like; a
      procedure never sufficiently to be deprecated, as tending to produce no
      results but perplexity and confusion. Where there, can be no definite
      basis of division, it is well to divide as little as may be; and it is to
      be hoped that secession from the heterogeneous commonwealth of the Hybrid
      Perpetuals will be effectually repressed. In regard to roses in general,
      while a classification founded on evident natural affinities is certainly
      desirable, yet, in the name of common sense, let us avoid the
      multiplication of new hybrid groups, founded on flimsy distinctions, and
      christened with new names, which begin with meaning little, and end with
      meaning nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our enumeration of the families and varieties of the rose, we shall
      make two great divisions,&mdash;that of the "Summer," or once-blooming,
      and that of the "Autumnal," or "ever-blooming" roses. In each of these
      divisions, we shall place first the roses of unmixed race, and, after
      them, the hybrids which have sprung from their combinations.

      CHAPTER VI. SUMMER ROSES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HESE ARE roses
      which bloom but once in the year; hence they have lost favor of late: for
      superb families of roses, fully equal in beauty, if not in hardiness, and
      endowed with an enviable power of renewing or perpetuating their charms,&mdash;of
      smiling in October as well as in June, and glowing in full effulgence even
      on the edge of winter,&mdash;have dazzled us into a forgetfulness of our
      ancient favorites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet all the poetry of the rose belongs to these old roses of summer. It is
      they that bloomed in white and red in the rival shields of York and
      Lancaster; and it is they that, time out of mind, have been the no silent
      interpreters of hearts too full to find a ruder utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the rest, they are, in the main, very hardy, very easy of culture, and
      often very beautiful.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0121.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      <i>Rosa Centifolia</i>.&mdash;This is the family of the old, well-known,
      and deservedly admired Cabbage Rose. Its ancestors, as we have seen, grew
      on Mount Caucasus; though some have supposed that it is a native of the
      south of France: hence the name Provence, by which it is often known in
      England, though it is never so designated in France. The French,
      translating its Latin name, Rosa Centifolia, or the Hundred-leaved Rose,
      commonly call it Rose à Cent Feuilles. It is supposed to have been known
      to the Romans, and to have been one of their favorite roses; and it was
      introduced into England before the end of the sixteenth century, where at
      least, until these latter days, it has been greatly admired and prized.
      Recently, however, the introduction of the families of hardy,
      ever-blooming roses, has thrown the Cabbage and all its compeers into the
      shade. Nevertheless, it is one of the most desirable of flowers; and even
      those who are disposed to pass it by with slight regard will never deny
      that some of the progeny which have arisen from it are unsurpassed in
      beauty and attractiveness. It is remarkable among roses for the singular
      changes, in horticultural language called "sports," which it has assumed,
      and which, among other results, have given rise to the entire family of
      Moss roses, of which we shall speak in the next section.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevailing colors in this group are light. The Cabbage Rose is a
      somewhat weak grower in a heavy soil, though in a light soil it grows
      vigorously. As a general rule, it needs close pruning. The members of the
      family are numerous; but, besides the Old Cabbage, the following are the
      best: The Dutch Provence is remarkable for the size of its flowers, in
      which respect it even surpasses the Old Cabbage. The Unique Provence is
      probably a sport from the Old Cabbage; that is to say, an accidental
      variation of the flowers on some particular branch; which branch being
      propagated, the accidental features become permanent. The Unique Provence,
      which is pure white, has, in its turn, produced another sport, called the
      Striped Unique, the flowers being white, striped with lake; though they
      are very capricious in their coloring, sometimes opening pure white, and
      occasionally light rose. But a more remarkable sport of the Provence is
      the variety called the Crested Provence, Rosa Cristata, or, very commonly
      among us, the Crested Moss. It is not, however, a true Moss, as its stems
      are smooth. Its peculiarity consists in a curious and very beautiful mossy
      growth about the calyx. This growth is developed in proportion to the
      vigor of the plant: therefore it should be strongly manured and closely
      pruned, as should the whole race of Provence roses. Adeline, the Duc de
      Choiseul, the Stadtholder, and, above all, the Reine de Provence, are
      beautiful varieties of this group. To it also belong a sub-group of
      Miniature or Pompone roses, well suited for edging beds. They bloom early,
      and are exceedingly pretty and graceful. Among the best of them are the
      White Burgundy, the Dwarf Burgundy, De Meaux, and Spong.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above are all old roses; for it is rarely that a cultivator of the
      present day will give himself the trouble to raise new varieties of any of
      the June roses, excepting always the Mosses, which can never be out of
      favor.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0040" id="linkimage-0040"> </a>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0123.jpg"><i>Original</i></a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      <i>Rosa Centifolia Muscosa</i>.&mdash;We have spoken of the tendency of
      the Provence Rose to "sport." The most widely known and the most beautiful
      of the results arising from this tendency is the Moss Rose and its
      varieties; for that such is the true origin of this unique family, there
      can be very little doubt. There is, however, no record of the first
      appearance of the Moss Rose. The original type of the race&mdash;the Old
      Red Moss&mdash;was introduced into England as early as 1596. It came
      immediately from Holland, but seems not to have originated there: indeed,
      to this day, we have remained in doubt as to whence it drew its birth. Of
      the large number of Moss roses now on the lists of nursery-men, some owe
      their origin to sporting branches, others to seed. Of the plants arising
      from the seed of a Moss rose, not more than one in three will show the
      characteristic of the parent; that is, the "moss," the rest will be mere
      varieties of the Provence Rose. Sometimes a Moss rose will put forth a
      branch perfectly free from the mossy covering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In cold, heavy soils, Moss roses are somewhat difficult of cultivation;
      but in a light, rich loam, and a sunny exposure, free from roots of
      growing trees, they thrive luxuriantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      They all require high enrichment. All excepting the strongest growers
      should be closely pruned; and, in the Northern States, it is well to give
      them protection in winter by means of pine-boughs, or by laying them down
      like raspberries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, as in other classes of the rose, the hybridist has been at work. By
      impregnating Moss roses with the pollen of some of the ever-blooming
      sorts, a group of Perpetual Mosses has been produced. These have, to a
      greater or less extent, the ever-blooming quality; but this is acquired at
      some sacrifice of the peculiar beauty of the moss. They will receive a
      separate notice. Again: these roses have been fertilized with the pollen
      of the Hybrid China Rose; and the result is a Moss rose, remarkably
      vigorous in growth, and particularly well suited to form pillars. Any,
      however, of the more vigorous Mosses may be used for this purpose,
      provided always that they receive the highest culture in a warm and open
      exposure. We have it on the authority of the well-known English
      rose-grower, Mr. Paul, that, in the garden of an amateur near Cheshunt,
      there is a pillar of the Old Red Moss fifteen feet high!
    </p>
    <p>
      At the present day, when the annual progeny of new Perpetual roses from
      the nurseries of France, with a humble re-enforcement from those of
      England, has eclipsed by numbers the old garden favorites, the
      well-remembered roses of our infancy, the Moss alone stands in tranquil
      defiance of this gay tide of innovation. Nothing can eclipse and nothing
      can rival her. She is, and ever will be, the favorite of poetry and art;
      and the eloquence of her opening buds, half wrapped in their mossy
      envelope, will remain through all generations a chosen interpreter of the
      language of youth and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alice Le Roy is a distinct and beautiful rose, very large, full, and
      mossy; color, lilac and rose; form, cupped: it grows vigorously. Angélique
      Quétier is also of a rosy-lilac hue, large, very double, and very mossy:
      it grows freely, like the former. The Blush Moss is of growth somewhat
      more moderate: the flower is large and full, the foliage fine, and stems
      and buds well mossed; color, clear pale pink. Celina is of a deep, rosy
      crimson, sometimes verging to purple. The Common, or Old Moss, is still
      one of the most beautiful of the whole family. Its flowers are large and
      full, and of a pale rose-color and globular form. It is more abundantly
      mossed than most of its progeny; and none of them surpass it, indeed very
      few equal it, in the beauty of its half-opened bud. Its growth is
      tolerably vigorous, and foliage fine. Laneh is a vigorous and beautiful
      rose; flowers large, full, and globular; color, a light rosy-crimson. The
      buds are large, full, and well mossed; its growth is vigorous; and, under
      good cultivation, the whole plant, with its large and bright-green
      foliage, bears a striking appearance of thrift and health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Luxembourg is of a deep crimson, moderately double, and of growth nearly
      as vigorous as the last, with which the deep hue of its buds forms a
      striking contrast. Malvina is a good rose, with clusters of pink flowers.
      Eclatante is of a deep pink, large, double, and well mossed. Comtesse de
      Murinais is one of the best of the White Mosses. Its flowers, though not
      so double as the Old Moss, are large, and of the purest white; and the
      growth is very vigorous. The Crimson or Tinwell Moss somewhat belies its
      name; for its flowers are rather of a deep rose than crimson. It is,
      however, a beautiful variety. Princess Adelaide is remarkable for the
      extreme vigor of its growth, and is evidently a hybrid of some of the
      Hybrid Bourbon or Hybrid China roses. It is admirably suited for a pillar
      or a wall, but requires a full sun, and, if closely pruned, will not bloom
      at all. It blooms in large clusters: the flowers are of a light glossy
      rose, very large and full; and, if not too closely pruned, they are very
      abundant. The White Bath is an admirable White Moss, large and full in
      flower, and exquisite in bud. As it is of moderate growth, it will bear
      dose pruning. Prolific is a very beautiful variety, resembling the Old
      Moss. Baronne de Wassenaër is a very vigorous rose, of a bright red, and
      flowering in clusters. Captain Ingram is of a dark, velvety purple. Gloire
      des Mousseuses is very large and double, and of a blush-color. Rosa
      Bonheur is of a bright rose-color. Nuits d'Young is of a very dwarfed
      growth, and small deep-purple flowers. Vandael is purple, edged with
      lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above afford excellent examples of the various characteristics of the
      family of the Mosses. Additions in considerable number are still made to
      it every year; but it is very rarely that any decisive improvement upon
      the old varieties is shown in the recent seedlings.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Moss roses, when grown on their own roots, require a light and rich soil:
      in such soils, they form fine masses of beauty in beds on lawns. The
      varieties best adapted to this purpose are the Common Moss, the Prolific,
      the Luxembourg, the Crimson, and Lane's Moss. Plants of these are
      procurable at a moderate price; and, by pegging down their shoots with
      hooked sticks, the surface of the bed will be covered with a mass of
      foliage and flowers. They require the same severe pruning as the Provence
      Rose. To have a succession of flowers on the same bed, half of the shoots
      may be shortened in March, the remainder the beginning of May, pruning
      closely as recommended for the Provence roses. By this method, the
      blooming season may be prolonged from a fortnight to three weeks. They
      should have an abundant animal dressing of manure on the surface in
      November, and the bed lightly stirred with the fork in February....
    </p>
    <p>
      "To raise Moss roses from seed is a most interesting employment for the
      genuine rose amateur; such a pleasing field is open, and so much may yet
      be done. The following directions will, I hope, assist those who have
      leisure, perseverance, and love for this charming flower. A plant of the
      Luxembourg Moss, or one of the Celina Moss, and one of the Single Crimson
      Moss, should be planted against a south wall, close to each other, so that
      their branches may be mingled. In bright, calm, sunny mornings, in June,
      about ten o'clock, those flowers that are expanded should be examined by
      pressing the fingers on the anthers. It will then be found if the pollen
      be abundant: if so, a flower of the former should be shaken over the
      latter; or, what perhaps is better, its flower-stalks should be fastened
      to the wall, so that the flower will be kept in an erect position. Then
      cut a flower of the Luxembourg Moss, strip off its petals with a sharp
      pair of scissors, and place the anthers firmly, but gently, upon a flower
      of the Single Crimson, so that the anthers of each are entangled: they
      will keep it in its position: a stiff breeze will then scarcely remove it.
      The fertilizing will take place without further trouble, and a fine hip
      full of seed will be the result. To obtain seed from the Luxembourg Moss,
      I need scarcely say that this operation must be reversed. A wall is not
      always necessary to ripen seed; for in dry soils, and airy, exposed
      situations, the above Moss roses bear seed in tolerable abundance. The
      treatment of the hips, sowing the seed, and the management of the young
      plants, as applicable to all, has already been given."&mdash;<i>Rivers.</i>

      <i>Rosa Damascena</i>.&mdash;Any deeply colored rose is popularly called a
      Damask; but the true Damask&mdash;the rose of Damascus&mdash;is of various
      shades, from the darkest to the lightest. All these varieties have sprung
      from one origin,&mdash;the wild rose of Syria, which was introduced into
      England in the year 1573, or, according to some writers, much earlier. It
      is this rose from which is made the rosewater of the East, and on this the
      Eastern poets and their Western imitators have lavished the wealth of
      their fancy. In poetry, indeed, the Damask Rose has woven more garlands
      than the Moss. Nor is it unknown to history, since the five hundred
      camel-loads of rose-water with which the Sultan Saladin purified the
      Mosque of Omar after it had been used as a Christian church were doubtless
      distilled from its leaves. But, without falling into an anachronism, it is
      hardly possible to claim for it, as some have done, the honor of having
      been the renowned Red Rose of Lancaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both the Damask and the Provence roses are extensively cultivated in
      France and England for the purpose of making rose-water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Damask is very hardy, vigorous of growth, and abundant in bloom. Its
      shoots are full of spines, and its leaves of a light green. Its old
      original varieties are wholly eclipsed by those which the industry of the
      florist has produced from their seed. The following are among the best of
      these:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      La Ville de Bruxelles is a very beautiful rose, of delicate waxy tint and
      vigorous growth. Madame Stoltz is of a pale straw or lemon color. Madame
      Soëtmans is of delicate cream-color, tinged with buff. Madame Hardy is a
      large and very full rose of the purest white. It has but one fault,&mdash;that
      of sometimes showing a green bud in the centre. But for this, it would be
      almost unrivalled among white roses. Leda is of a blush tint, edged with
      lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are but few new varieties of this family, as the double sorts do not
      bear seed freely.

      <i>Rosa Alba</i>.&mdash;The parent of the Alba, or White roses, is a
      native of Central Europe. The species is so called from the prevailing
      delicacy of hue in its varieties, many of which are of a pure white, while
      none are of a deeper coloring than a bright pink. The original stock is
      spineless; but many of its progeny, in consequence, probably, of
      hybridization, have spines in greater or less number. The upper surface of
      the leaves has a glaucous or whitish tinge, and the shoots are of a clear
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      Félicité is a large double rose, of a delicate flesh-color, and a most
      symmetrical shape. La Séduisante is of a bright rose in the centre,
      shading into flesh-color at the circumference: it rivals the last in the
      perfection of its shape. Madame Audot is of a pale flesh-color. Madame
      Legras is a white rose of a peculiar delicacy, and very graceful in its
      habit of growth. The Queen of Denmark is of a clear rosy pink. Sophie de
      Marsilly is of a delicate rose-color, slightly mottled, and, when half
      opened, is a rose of remarkable beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Alba roses bloom abundantly, and form in masses a beautiful contrast,
      in their chaste and delicate hues, with the deeper colors of the French
      and Hybrid China roses. They rarely bear seed freely.

      <i>Rosa Gallica</i>.&mdash;This rose draws its origin from the south of
      Europe, where its wild progenitor still grows abundantly in the hedges. It
      is one of the best known, and longest under cultivation, of all the
      species. We confess our strong partiality for it. It is perfectly hardy,
      compact in growth, abundant in bloom, beautiful in form, and rich and
      various in coloring. It will grow and bloom anywhere, and endures neglect
      with a patience unknown to most others of its race. Yet none better
      rewards a careful and generous culture. It returns a rich response to the
      care bestowed upon it; and, under high cultivation, the members of this
      group have no superiors in beauty. It is not, however, in favor at the
      present day. Roses of equal beauty, though, not of equal hardihood, and
      endowed with the one valuable quality in which it is wanting,&mdash;that
      of continuous or repeated blooming,&mdash;have, of late, supplanted it. We
      may as well say here, while protesting against the neglect into which the
      hardy June roses have fallen, that, of the so-called Perpetuals, a great
      many are undeserving of the name. Some, even with tolerably good
      treatment, rarely show a flower after the June blooming; and none will put
      forth freely and abundantly in autumn, without more pains in the
      management than most persons are willing to bestow.

      The French Rose has been known in England since the close of the sixteenth
      century. It is very prolific, and innumerable seedlings have been raised
      from it. Some of these produce flowers exceedingly double, of the most
      vivid color, and remarkable even now for the symmetry of their forms.
      Among the rest is a great variety of marbled, striped, and spotted roses,
      which, though curious and interesting, are certainly less beautiful than
      the "self-colored" sorts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The varieties of this rose formerly catalogued and cultivated might be
      numbered by hundreds. Of these, it is needless to mention any but a few of
      the best and most distinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Boula de Nanteuil is a rose of the richest crimson-purple, with a centre,
      at times, of a vivid red. It varies, however, very much in different
      seasons, and, while sometimes splendid in coloring, is occasionally dull
      and cloudy. Grandissima is of a deep purplish-rose, very large and double.
      Kean closely resembles it. Adele Prévost is of a silvery blush.
      Blanchefleur is white, with a tinge of flesh-color. Cynthia is of a pale
      rose. The Duchess of Buccleugh is of a dark rose. Ohl is of a deep crimson
      and scarlet, and, when grown in perfection, is one of the finest roses in
      existence. La Reine des Français is also of a bright crimson. Perle des
      Panachées is white, striped with rose; and Oeillet Parfait is white,
      striped with light crimson, much like a carnation. D'Aguesseau, Gloire de
      Colmar, Latour d'Auvergne, Triomphe de Jaussens, Letitia, Napoléon, Duc de
      Valmy, and Transon Goubault, are all excellent roses of this family.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To grow them fine for exhibition, as single blooms or 'show-roses,' the
      clusters of buds should be thinned early in June, taking at least
      two-thirds of the incipient flowers from each: manure should also be laid
      round their stems on the surface, and manure-water given to them
      plentifully in dry weather. With this description of culture, these roses
      will much surpass any thing we have yet seen in this country.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Although the varieties of this group are summer roses only, their period
      of flowering may be prolonged by judicious pruning; and for this purpose
      two trees of each variety should be planted, one to be pruned in October,
      the other early in May, or just when the buds have burst into leaf: these
      will give a regular succession of flowers. In pruning, cut out with a
      sharp knife all the spray-like shoots, and then shorten to within six or
      eight buds of their base all the strong shoots (by such I mean those that
      are above fifteen inches in length): the weak shoots cut down to two or
      three buds. This is the pruning required by the Alba, Damask, and Hybrid
      Provence roses....
    </p>
    <p>
      "To raise French roses from seed, they should be planted in a warm, dry
      border sloping to the south, in an open, airy situation: the shade of
      trees is very pernicious to seed-bearing roses. The following kinds * may
      be selected, as they bear seed freely: The Tuscany Rose, a very old
      variety, with rich, deep crimson, semi-double flowers; also Ohl and Latour
      d'Auvergne. The two latter should have their flowers fertilized with the
      pollen of the Tuscany Rose, and some fine crimson roses will probably be
      raised. The Village Maid and Oillet Parfait are the most eligible to raise
      striped roses from: if their flowers are deficient in pollen, they should
      be fertilized with those of Rosa Mundi."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * Some of the roses recommended for seed-bearing are old
     varieties, which may be procured from any old-fashioned
     English rose-nursery.
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Rosa Indica Hybrida</i>.&mdash;This class has been divided by some
      writers into three; viz., Hybrid China, Hybrid Noisette, and Hybrid
      Bourbon. The division seems to us needless, for the reason that all these,
      on analysis, resolve themselves into hybrids of the Chinese Rose, since
      both the Noisette and the Bourbon owe their distinctive character to their
      Chinese parentage. The hybrids of the Noisettes are usually inclined to
      bloom in clusters: those of the Bourbons are distinguishable by their
      large, smooth, and thick leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      This class, then, may be defined as the offspring of intermarriage of the
      French and other June roses with the Chinese Rose and its hybrids. It has,
      however, none of the ever-blooming qualities which distinguish the China
      roses. It is remarkable, as a class, for vigor of growth, in which,
      strange as it may appear, it surpasses, in some cases, both its parents.
      Most of the Hybrid China roses are, moreover, perfectly hardy even in the
      climate of the Northern States; and they are admirably adapted for forming
      pillars. For this purpose, they should be planted in a very deep and rich
      soil. If the soil is naturally poor, dig it out to the width and depth of
      three feet, and replace it with a mixture of strong loam and old manure.
      Some of the Hybrid Chinas thus generously treated, and trained and pruned
      in the manner recommended in a former chapter, will form most gorgeous
      decorations of a garden; for in the size of the flowers, in beauty of
      form, and brilliancy of color, some of the varieties are unsurpassed.
      Every autumn, the surface of the soil around the stem should be covered
      with manure to the depth of several inches; and this should be allowed to
      remain throughout the summer, renewing it as often as necessary, after a
      previous forking-up of the soil, which this covering or "mulching"
      enriches, at the same time that it keeps it moist and cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are among the best of this family of roses: Beauty op
      Billiard, of vigorous growth, and bright-scarlet and crimson flowers.
      Brennus, or Brutus, is a superb rose, of great size, and strong, rapid
      growth. Blair, No. 2, is particularly adapted for a pillar rose; its bloom
      being very profuse. The color of its flowers is pink or blush. George the
      Fourth is an old rose raised some forty years ago by the excellent English
      cultivator, Mr. Rivers. Its bright crimson color and its neat foliage make
      it very attractive, though it is less double than some other varieties.
      The Duke op Devonshire is of a lilac-color, striped with white, and
      perfect in form; its petals overlapping with the greatest regularity.
      Charles Duval is of a deep pink; Charles Lawson, of a vivid rose.
      Chenedolé is regarded by many as the best rose of the class; for its color
      is the brightest and clearest crimson, and its flowers are large and very
      full. Inferior roses, however, are frequently sold under its name,
      especially in I this country. Coupe d'Hébé is remarkable both for the
      perfection of its cup-like form, and for the delicate rose-color of its
      petals. Its growth is very vigorous; and, like most of its kindred, it is
      perfectly hardy. General Jacqueminot is a large purplish-crimson rose. It
      must not be confounded with the Hybrid Perpetual of the same name. Fulgens
      is of a deep crimson. Triomphe de Bayeux is white, and an excellent
      pillar-rose. Madame Plantier is also white, but very distinct from the
      last; for, as it sprang on the mother's side from the Noisette, it blooms
      in dusters. Its individual flowers are surpassed by those of one or two
      other white roses; but the extraordinary profusion of its bloom, its
      graceful habit, its neat foliage, and its hardy, enduring nature, make it,
      on the whole, the best rose of its color in cultivation. Paul Perras is
      Bourbon on the mother's side, as is also Paul Ricaut. The first is of a
      pale rose, the second of a bright crimson. Vivid is a seedling of the
      English rose-grower, Mr. William Paul. Its flowers are not large, but they
      are of the most vivid crimson; and the vigorous habit of the plant makes
      it very suitable either for a pillar or a trellis.
    </p>
    <p>
      "When grown as large standards, these roses require peculiar pruning. If
      their shoots are shortened too much, they will grow vigorously, but give
      no flowers. They should, therefore, be thinned out, so that the head of
      the tree is not at all crowded, and then be shortened to within twelve
      buds of their base: a crop of fine flowers will then be produced. This is
      the pruning to be done either in the early part of November or in
      February: we will call it the winter pruning. * There is another mode of
      pruning these roses, partly in summer, which will be found highly
      eligible. Thin out the shoots in the winter, and leave a selected number
      of those that are most vigorous nearly their full length, merely cutting
      off their tips: these will be loaded with blossoms so as to make the trees
      quite pendulous. As soon as the blooming season is past, shorten them all
      to within six inches of their base. They will immediately put forth strong
      shoots, which, while in a very young state, thin out, leaving those that
      are the most vigorous. These shoots treat in the same manner the following
      year. By this method of pruning, a pendulous, graceful head is formed,
      instead of a stiff, formal one, so common to standard roses. In pruning
      these roses, when trained as pillars, the spurs from the shoots fastened
      to the stake merely require thinning out, so as not to be crowded, and
      then shortened to within five or six buds of their base. Trained as
      pillar-roses, they give flowers often too abundantly; so that they are
      small and ill-shaped: it is, therefore, often a good practice to thin the
      flower-buds as soon as they can be distinguished.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * These directions, it will be remembered, are for the
     climate of England. The November pruning will not do here;
     indeed, it will require much precaution to make even the
     hardy roses succeed as standards.

      "The Duke of Devonshire, in a very warm and dry soil, will produce hips in
      tolerable abundance; and, as it is inclined to be striped, it would
      possibly form a beautiful combination with some striped rose, which should
      be planted with it.

      "General Allard, a hybrid rose, from which Monsiem Laffay raised his
      perpetual rose, Madame Laffay, is much inclined to give a second series of
      flowers. This rose should be planted in a very warm border, or trained
      against a south wall with Bourbon Gloire de Rosomènes; and, if carefully
      fertilized with it, some beautiful crimson autumnal roses would probably
      be originated. Chênedolé may also be subjected to the same treatment. What

      <i>Rosa Spinosissima.</i>&mdash;The original Scotch Rose is a wild dwarf
      rose, common in Scotland and the north of England. As it bears seed in
      great abundance, as these seeds vegetate freely, and as the Scotch
      gardeners have taken pride in multiplying and improving this native growth
      of the soil, the number of varieties is nominally immense. Many of them,
      however, are scarcely to be distinguished the one from the other. The
      flowers are small, and exceedingly numerous. They bloom earlier than most
      roses, and show various shades of crimson, rose, white, and yellow,&mdash;or
      rather straw-color; for the yellow Scotch Rose is apparently a hybrid.
      They are useful for covering banks and forming clumps where masses of
      bloom are required. Nothing can exceed their hardiness, and they increase
      abundantly by suckers. A list of named varieties of the Scotch Rose would,
      from their multiplicity, and want of distinctness, be even more
      unsatisfactory than the florist's lists of pansies or verbenas. The
      following, however, are good:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      La Neige is pure white, and very double. Guy Mannering is of a deep blush.
      Sulphurea, Lady Balllie, and the Marchioness of Lansdowne, are of a pale
      straw or sulphur color. The Yellow Scotch is of a deeper yellow tint.
      Flora, Daphne, Erebus, Venus, and the Countess of Glasgow, are of deep
      shades of rose and crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Scotch roses, when grown into beds and clumps as dwarfs, are beautiful;
      and in early seasons they will bloom nearly a fortnight before the other
      summer roses make their appearance. This, of course, makes them desirable
      appendages to the flower-garden. They bear seed profusely; and raising new
      varieties from seed will be found a most interesting employment. To do
      this, all that is required is to sow the seed as soon as ripe, in October,
      in pots or beds of fine earth, covering it with nearly an inch of mould:
      the succeeding spring they will come up, and bloom in perfection the
      season following.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The aim should be to obtain varieties with large and very double crimson
      flowers: this can only be done by slightly hybridizing; and to effect this
      it will be necessary to have a plant or two of the Tuscany Rose trained to
      a south wall, so that their flowers are expanded at the same time as the
      Scotch roses in the open borders: unless thus forced, they will be too
      late. Any dark-red varieties of the Scotch roses, such as Venus, Erebus,
      or Flora, should be planted separately from others, and their flowers
      fertilized with the above French Rose. Some very original deep-colored
      varieties will probably be obtained by this method. Sulphurea and one or
      two other straw-colored varieties may be planted with the Double Yellow
      Austrian Brier; and most likely some pretty sulphur-colored roses will be
      the result of this combination."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Rosa Lutea</i>.&mdash;This is a small family of roses, very distinct in
      all its characteristics; a native of Southern Europe and of some parts of
      the East. It is seldom that any seedlings have been obtained from it, as
      its flowers, even in the single varieties, are usually barren. They may,
      however, be made productive by fertilizing them with the pollen of other
      varieties. Its stems are spiny, and of a reddish or brownish color. Its
      leaves are small, and its growth somewhat straggling. The colors of its
      flowers are copper and yellow in various shades. It should not be pruned
      too closely; but the shoots may with great advantage be pinched back in
      midsummer, thus causing them to throw out a great number of lateral
      shoots, and correcting the loose and straggling habit of the bush. The
      bloom, with this treatment, is very profuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The best known roses of this family are five in number. The Single
      Austrian Yellow and the Single Austrian Copper may be regarded as the
      original types of the species. William's Double Yellow is an English
      seedling of a pale-yellow color. Harrison's Yellow is an excellent yellow
      rose, originated in America. It is very vigorous in growth, and, on the
      whole, the best yellow rose for general cultivation. The Persian Yellow,
      however, is of a much deeper hue, and is unrivalled in its way. It is one
      of those roses which are feeble on their own roots, but grow very
      vigorously either on the Dog Rose or on the Manetti stock. It is said to
      have originated, as its name imports, from Persia.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moist soil, and a dry, pure air, are essential to the growth of all this
      family of roses.

      "No family of roses offers such an interesting field for experiments in
      raising new varieties from seed as this. First we have the Copper
      Austrian, from which, although it is one of the oldest roses in our
      gardens, a double flowering variety has never yet been obtained. This rose
      is always defective in pollen; and consequently it will not bear seed
      unless its flowers are fertilized. As it will be interesting to retain the
      traits of the species, it should be planted with and fertilized by the
      Double Yellow: it will then, in warm, dry seasons, produce seed, not
      abundantly; but the amateur must rest satisfied if he can procure even one
      hip-full of perfect seed.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The beautiful and brilliant Rosa Harrison, however, gives the brightest
      hopes. This should be planted with the Double Yellow Brier: it will then
      bear seed abundantly. No rose will, perhaps, show the effects of
      fertilizing its flowers more plainly than this; and consequently, to the
      amateur, it is the pleasing triumph of Art over Nature. Every flower on my
      experimental plants, not fertilized, proved abortive; while, on the
      contrary, all those that were so, produced large black spherical hips-full
      of perfect seed. The Persian Yellow does not seem inclined to bear seed;
      but it may be crossed with Rosa Harrison, and, I trust, with some good
      effect."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.

      <i>Rosa Sulphurea</i>.&mdash;This beautiful rose is difficult of
      cultivation both in England and in this country, though in Italy and the
      south of France it grows and blooms luxuriantly. Its original species is
      found growing wild, and yielding single flowers, on the Himalaya
      Mountains, and also, it is said, in Persia. Only two varieties are in
      cultivation,&mdash;the Double (called also the Yellow Provence) and the
      Dwarf Double. The climate of the Southern and Middle States is far more
      suitable to them than that of the North; though it is more than probable,
      that, with careful and judicious treatment, they would do well even here.
      They need a rich diet, and a sunny and airy situation, to induce them to
      expand their flower-buds, which are provokingly apt to fall before
      opening. They are also very liable to the attacks of insects. The
      difficulty of the cultivation of this rose is greatly to be lamented,
      since it surpasses even the Persian Yellow in beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Various situations," says Mr. Rivers, "have been recommended. Some have
      said, 'Plant it against a south wall;' others, 'Give it a northern aspect,
      under the drip of some water-trough, as it requires a wet situation.' All
      this is quackery and nonsense. The Yellow Provence Rose is a native of a
      warm climate, and therefore requires a warm situation, a free and airy
      exposure, and rich soil: a wall with a south-east or north-west aspect
      will be found eligible. Give the plants surface-manure every autumn, and
      water with manure-water in May; prune with the finger and thumb in summer,
      as recommended for the Persian Yellow. *
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * M. Godefroy, a French nursery-man, has cultivated it as a
     pillar-rose, in a free and open situation, with much
     success. Manuring as above, and summer pruning, are
     indispensable.
</pre>
    <p>
      "At Burleigh, the seat of the Marquis of Exeter, the effect of situation
      on this rose is forcibly shown. A very old plant is growing against the
      southern wall of the mansion, in a confined situation, its roots cramped
      by a stone pavement: it is weakly, and never shows a flower-bud. In the
      entrance-court is another plant, growing in front of a low parapet wall,
      in a good loamy soil, and free, airy exposure: this is in a state of the
      greatest luxuriance, and blooms in fine perfection nearly every season.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Mr. Mackintosh, the gardener, who kindly pointed out these plants to me,
      thought the latter a distinct and superior variety, as it was brought from
      France by a French cook a few years since; but it is certainly nothing but
      the genuine Old Double Yellow Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      "In unfavorable soils, it will often flourish and bloom freely if budded
      on the Musk Rose, the common China Rose, or some free-growing hybrid China
      Rose; but the following pretty method of culture I beg to suggest: Bud or
      graft it on some short stems of the Rosa Manetti. In the autumn, pot some
      of the strongest plants; and, late in spring, force them with a gentle
      heat, giving plenty of air. It will now also be very interesting to plant
      trees of this variety in orchard-houses: this seems to me to be the exact
      climate required by it. By this method, the dry and warm climate of
      Florence and Genoa may, perhaps, be partially imitated; for there it
      blooms in such profusion, that large quantities of its magnificent flowers
      are daily sold in the markets during the rose-season.
    </p>
    <p>
      "The following extract relative to this rose is from the quaint old book,
      'Flora, Ceres, and Pomona, by John Rea, Gent., 1655,' showing that budding
      and double-budding of roses and trees is no new idea: 'The Double Yellow
      Rose is the most unapt of all others to bear kindly and fair flowers,
      unless it be ordered and looked unto in an especial manner. For whereas
      all other roses are best natural, this is best inoculated upon another
      stock. Others thrive and bear best in the sun, this in the shade.
      Therefore the best way that I know to cause this rose to bring forth fair
      and kindly flowers is performed after this manner: First, in the stock of
      a Francford * Rose, near the ground, put in a bud of the Single Yellow
      Rose, which will quickly shoot to a good length; then, half a yard higher
      than the place where the same was budded, put into it a bud of the Double
      Yellow Rose; which growing, the suckers must be kept from the root, and
      all the buds rubbed off, except those of the kind desired; which being
      grown big enough to bear (which will be in the two years), it must in
      winter be pruned very near, cutting off all the small shoots, and only
      leaving the biggest, cutting off the tops of them also, as far as they are
      small; then in the spring, when the buds for leaves come forth, rub off
      the smallest of them, leaving only some few of the biggest, which by
      reason of the strength of the stock affording more nourishment than any
      other, and the agreeable nature of the Single Yellow Rose (from whence it
      is immediately nourished), the shoots will be then strong, and able to
      bear out the flowers if they be not too many, which may be prevented by
      nipping off the smallest buds for flowers, leaving only such a number of
      the fairest as the tree may be able to bring to perfection; which tree
      should stand something shadowed, and not too much in the heat of the sun,
      and in a standard by itself, rather than under a wall. These rules being
      observed, we may expect to enjoy the full delight of these beautiful
      roses, as I myself have often done by my own practice in divers trees so
      handled, which have yearly borne store of fair flowers, when those that
      were natural, not withstanding all the helps I could use, have not brought
      forth one that was kindly, but all of them either broken, or, as it were,
      blasted.'"

      Nothing is easier than its cultivation; but, to our mind, it loses half
      its attraction when transplanted from its native road-side or thicket into
      the garden. From its perfect hardiness and free growth, it is sometimes
      used as a stock for budding or grafting. The fragrance of its leaves
      readily distinguishes it from other species.

      <i>Rosa Alpina</i>.&mdash;This familiar climbing rose is easily known by
      its long shoots, nearly or quite free from thorns, and the reddish tinge,
      shaded into green, which marks the stems of most of the varieties. Its
      parent is a native of the Alps, and it is perfectly hardy. The flowers
      grow in clusters. In the Old Red Boursault, they are semidouble, and
      indifferently formed; but some of the other varieties show great
      improvements both in shape and color. They are excellent climbing or
      pillar roses, and require less sun to develop their flowers than most
      other species. Like other climbing roses, they should be primed but
      little, though the old stems should be well thinned out.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Amadis</i>, or the Crimson Boursault, is of a deep purplish-crimson,
      with large semi-double flowers. The Blush Boursault is, in its flowers,
      larger and more full than most others of the species. They are of a deep
      flesh-color, passing into a lighter shade towards the edge. It can
      scarcely owe its qualities to the Boursault race alone, but seems to be a
      hybrid of some of the Chinese roses. When in perfection, it is much the
      best of the group, but requires a warmer and brighter aspect than the
      others. It is, however, perfectly hardy. This variety is also called
      Calypso, De l'Isle, The White Boursault, and Florida. Inermis Elegans and
      Gracilis are the only other varieties of the group that need be mentioned
      here.

      <i>Rosa Arvensis Hybrida</i>.&mdash;The origin of the Ayrshire Rose has
      been the subject of some discussion among botanists and cultivators. It is
      generally supposed, however, to have sprung from the seed of a wild
      trailing rose common in Great Britain and in Western Europe, the flowers
      of which had been impregnated by accident or design with the pollen of
      some other species. The Ayrshire roses are known in Europe for their
      astonishing vigor of growth; some species, it is said, growing nearly
      thirty feet in a year,&mdash;an achievement which we never knew them to
      equal in this country. Their growth, however, is very rapid; and, when
      once established, their long, slender shoots quickly possess themselves of
      every object near them. As may be gathered from their name, most of them
      originated in Scotland. In Europe, these roses are valued as standard
      weepers, since, when budded on tall stocks, they form huge heads of
      pendulous foliage and bloom. Doubtless they would succeed as well or
      better in our Southern and Middle States; but in the North they would
      probably require, in common with other standard roses, a careful
      protection against the changes of the seasons.

      Bennett's Seedling and the Dundee Rambler have white flowers; those of the
      last being not fully double. The Countess of Lieven is creamy-white and
      semidouble. Splendens is white, edged with red; and the Queen of the
      Belgians is of a cream-color. The Ayrshire Queen is of a dark
      crimson-purple, and less vigorous in growth than the rest. Ruga is of a
      pale flesh-color. Like the last, it is a hybrid, probably between the Tea
      Rose and one of the Ayrshires; for it has much of the fragrance of the
      former.

      "I have a steep bank of a hard white clay," says an English writer,
      "which, owing to a cutting made in the road, became too steep for
      cultivation. About sixteen years since, this was planted with Ayrshire and
      other climbing roses. Holes were made in the hard soil with a pick, two
      feet over and two feet deep; some manure mixed with the clay, after it had
      lain exposed to frost to mellow it, and climbing roses planted. This bank
      is, when the roses are in bloom, a mass of beauty: I have never seen any
      thing in climbing roses to equal it. On another bank, they are gradually
      mounting to the tops of the trees: none of them have ever been pruned.
      Ayrshire roses, as articles of decoration in places unfitted for other
      ornamental climbers, are worthy of much more attention than they have
      hitherto received."

    <p>
      The following extract from the "Dundee Courier" of July 11,1837, will give

      "Some years ago, a sand-pit at Ellangowan was filled up with rubbish found
      in digging a well. Over this a piece of rock was formed for the growth of
      plants which prefer such situations, and amongst them were planted some
      half-dozen plants of the Double Ayrshire Rose, raised in this neighborhood
      about ten years ago. These roses now most completely cover the whole
      ground,&mdash;a space of thirty feet by twenty. At present they are in
      full bloom, showing probably not less than ten thousand roses in this
      small space."

      <i>Rosa Sempervirens</i>.&mdash;This is a climbing rose of very vigorous
      growth, a native of the middle and south of Europe. The garden varieties
      originated from it bloom in clusters of small and usually very double
      flowers, of which the prevailing tints are light, varying from delicate
      shades of rose and pink to a pure white. They are not absolutely
      evergreen, but only partially so, retaining their bright, glossy leaves
      till spring, provided they are planted in shady and sheltered places, as
      under trees, or in the angles of walls, but dropping them in open
      situations. In England they have come into great favor as pillar-roses,
      and for covering walls, banks, or unsightly objects in the garden or on
      the pleasure-ground. Budded on tall stems of the Dog Rose, they form
      pendulous standards of magnificent proportions; rivalling, in this
      respect, the Ayrshire. Whether such standards would be equally successful
      in the Northern States, is, to say the least, doubtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the varieties of the Evergreen Rose now most in esteem were
      originated in the gardens of Reuilly, near Paris, by M. Jacques, gardener
      to King Louis Philippe. One or two are crossed with the Musk Rose; whence
      they acquire a fragrance in which their own race is deficient.
      Bankslæflora is one of these. It has small double white flowers. Félicite
      Perpétuée, in spite of its preposterous name, is one of the most beautiful
      of climbing roses; and trained as it sometimes is in European gardens,
      drooping in graceful festoons from pillar to pillar on supporting wires,
      or mantling some unsightly dead trunk with its foliage of shining green
      and its countless clusters of creamy white flowers, it forms one of the
      most attractive objects imaginable. Thin out its shoots; but do not prune
      them, since, if they are much shortened, they will yield no flowers
      whatever. Give it a rich soil, with autumnal top-dressing of manure; a
      treatment good for the whole group, and, indeed, for all climbing roses.
      Donna Maria has pure white flowers. Its growth is less vigorous than
      others, its foliage light green, and it blooms in large clusters.
      Myrianthes Rénoncule has flowers of a pale peach-color, drooping in large
      clusters, and in form resembling a double ranunculus. Rosa Plena is of a
      bright flesh-color, large and double. Princesse Marie is reddish-pink.
      Fortune's Yellow is a native of China and Japan, and is sometimes included
      in this class. It is of a bright fawn-color, with a tinge of copper;
      beautiful under shelter, but will not bear a winter exposure in the
      Northern States. It is of comparatively recent introduction. Rampante
      blooms profusely in clusters of pure white. Flora is of a bright rose;
      Leopoldine d'Orléans, white, tinged with rose; and Spectabilis,
      rosy-lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      While some of this race are perfectly hardy, others will require
      protection against a Northern winter. The ease of their culture, their
      rapid growth, and their admirable effect where masses of flowers and
      verdure are desired, will commend them all to favor in the Middle and
      Southern States.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I know of no rose idea," says Mr. Rivers, "prettier than that of a
      wilderness of evergreen roses, the varieties planted promiscuously, and
      suffered to cover the surface of the ground with their entangled shoots.
      To effect this, the ground should be dug, manured, and thoroughly cleaned
      from perennial weeds, such as couch-grass, &amp;c., and the plants planted
      from three to five feet asunder. If the soil be rich, the latter distance
      will do. They must be hoed amongst, and kept clean from weeds after
      planting, till the branches meet: they will then soon form a beautiful
      mass of foliage and flowers, covering the soil too densely for weeds of
      minor growth to flourish. Those weeds that are more robust should be
      pulled out occasionally; and this is all the culture they will require.
      For temples, columns, wire-fences, which they soon cover with beauty, and
      verandas, their use is now becoming well known. One of the most complete
      temples of roses is that at the seat of&mdash;&mdash;-Warner, Esq.,
      Hoddesdon, Hertfordshire; and the prettiest specimens of festooning these
      roses from one column to another by means of small iron chains (strong
      iron wire will do) may be seen at Broxbourn Bury, near Hoddesdon, the seat
      of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-Bosanquet, Esq.

    <p>
      "... About six or eight years ago, I received, among others, some very
      stout short stocks of the Dog Rose: they were not more than two feet in
      height, but stouter than a large broom-handle, the bark thick and gray
      with age. They were planted, and grew most luxuriantly. I was for some
      little time at a loss what varieties to bud them with; for, be it
      remembered, all stout and old rose-stocks require to be worked with very
      strong-growing sorts of roses, to take off the abundance of sap, and keep
      them in a healthy state. At last, in a mere freak of fancy, I had them
      budded with some varieties of the Evergreen Rose (<i>Rosa Sempervirens</i>).
      They grew most luxuriantly; and after a year or two, not being trees
      adapted for sale, they were planted in a sloping bank of strong white
      clay, and left to grow and bloom as Nature dictated: not a shoot was ever
      touched with the pruning-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      "One of these trees is on a stem a trifle more than two feet in height,
      and it has been these two or three summers past a picture of beauty. When
      in full bloom, the ends of its shoots rest on the ground, and it then
      forms a perfect dome of roses: nothing in rose-culture can really be more
      beautiful. It will be at once seen with what facility such stout, short,
      old rose-stocks can be found in any hedge. They may be planted in the
      kitchen-garden, budded with the above-mentioned sort, and, to give variety
      in color, with some of the following kinds,&mdash;all varieties of Rosa
      Sempervirens, Myrianthes, Jaunâtre, Adelaide d'Orléans, and Spectabilis.
      Every bud will succeed, as no roses grow more freely; and, after remaining
      one season from budding in their 'nursery,' some nice places must be found
      for them on the lawn, where, unpruned, unchecked, they will, with all the
      freshness of unassisted Nature, annually delight the eye of the lover of
      flowers." *

      <i>Rosa Multiflora</i>.&mdash;The parent of this family belongs to Japan
      and China. With few exceptions, we cannot recommend them to Northern
      cultivators for growth in the open air, as they bear our winters but
      indifferently, and, in some cases, are killed outright. Russelliana, or
      Scarlet Grevillia, blooms in large clusters of a rich, dark lake, changing
      to various shades of red and lilac, so that the cluster presents a curious
      diversity of hue. As it is extremely vigorous in growth, it would make an
      admirable pillar or climbing rose, were it but a little more hardy. It
      would, no doubt, succeed if the pillar were protected during winter by
      fastening around it a covering of pine or spruce boughs. These exclude
      sun, but not air; so that the rose is not exposed to the dangers from
      dampness which attend a compact mass of straw soaked by rain and snow. As
      Russelliana bears pruning better than most climbing roses, it may be grown
      as a bush; in which state it has flourished here for a number of years
      without protection. De la Grifferaie may also be grown as a bush with
      perfect success as far North as Boston. It gives a great abundance of
      blush and rose-colored flowers, forming a high mound of bloom. Laura
      Davoust forms an admirable greenhouse stock for rafter roses. Indeed, it
      is well worth a place for its own sake. Its small double flowers of bright
      pink and flesh-color, changing to white, are produced in large and
      graceful clusters, beautiful from the varieties of shade which they
      exhibit. Carmin Velouté, Alba, and Coccinea are also good varieties of
      this family, the value of which is greatly diminished by the imperfect
      hardiness of many of its members.

      The following are roses of doubtful parentage, several of them much
      esteemed abroad; though, for the most part, they have not been
      sufficiently tried here to establish their merit and their hardiness in
      our Northern climate. All those named below bear an English winter.

      Madame d'Arblay, or Wells's White, is of a light flesh-color, and its
      growth is exceedingly vigorous. The Garland is of a light fawn-color,
      changing to white, and blooms in large clusters of double flowers, which
      turn to pink before fading. Sir John Sebright has small semidouble crimson
      flowers, a color valuable in a climbing rose, because not very common.
      Menoux is also crimson. Indica Major is of a pale blush. Among others
      under this head may be mentioned Astrolabe, Bengale Formidable, Queen, and
      Clair. The last, however, is but a moderate grower for a climbing rose.

      "Among climbing roses, but few can be found that will bear seed in
      England, the Ayrshire roses excepted, from some of which it is probable
      that some fine and original climbers may be raised. A most desirable
      object to obtain is a dark crimson Rosa ruga: this may possibly be
      accomplished by planting that favorite rose with the Ayrshire Queen, and
      fertilizing its flowers very carefully with those of that dark rose. It is
      remarkable, that although these roses are both hybrids, from species
      apparently very remote in their affinities, yet both of them bear seed,
      even without being fertilized. The Blush Ayrshire, a most abundant
      seed-bearer, may also be planted with the Ayrshire Queen, the Gloire de
      Rosomènes, the Double Yellow Brier, Single Crimson Moss, Celina Moss, the
      China Rose Fabvier, and its flowers fertilized with the pollen of these
      roses: if any combination can be effected, pleasing results may reasonably
      be hoped for. To make assurance doubly sure, the anthers of the Ayrshire
      Rose should be removed from some of the flowers with which the experiment
      is tried."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.

      <i>Rosa Banksia</i>.&mdash;This very beautiful and very singular family
      more resembles in bloom a double Spiraea prunifolia, dwarf almond, or
      Chinese plum, than a rose. Its shoots are long, flexible, and graceful,
      and its foliage of a deep, polished green. In the flowering season, each
      shoot is like a pendulous garland of white, yellow, or rose-colored
      blossoms, small in size, and countless in number. It is not hardy here, or
      even in England; but it is one of the few once-blooming roses that are
      worth training on a greenhouse rafter. We have found it to succeed in a
      house without fire, with the protection of straw placed around it in
      winter. It will then bloom in the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      This rose is a native of China, and was named in compliment to Lady Banks.
      In Italy and the south of France it grows to perfection, climbing with an
      astonishing vigor, and covering every object within its reach. According
      to the French writer Deslongchamps, there was in 1842 a Banksia Rose at
      Toulon, of which the stem was, at its base, two feet and four inches in
      circumference; while the largest of the six branches measured a foot in
      girth. Its foliage covered a space of wall seventy-five feet wide, and
      about eighteen feet high; and it sometimes produced shoots fifteen feet
      long in a single year. It flowered in April and May; from fifty to sixty
      thousand of its double white blossoms opening at once, with an effect
      which the writer describes as magical. This remarkable tree was then about
      thirty-four years old. Deslongchamps also describes another Banksia Rose
      at Caserta, in the kingdom of Naples, which climbed to the top of a poplar
      sixty feet high, killed it with its embraces, and mantled its lifeless
      form with its rich green drapery, and its flowery garlands and festoons of
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      Banksian roses must not be shortened much; for, if they are, they will not
      bloom. The branches may be thinned out, however, to any degree necessary.
      The strong, thick shoots of overgrown proportions, and often but half
      ripened, which they sometimes make towards the end of summer, should be
      cut out, as they draw too much life from the blooming part of the plant.
      The same rule will also apply to many other species. These gross and
      immature shoots occur in many roses, both in the open ground and under
      glass; and, as they rarely produce good flowers, they should not be
      suffered to rob the rest of the plant of its nourishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Double White Banksia is the best known, and one of the most beautiful.
      Jaunâtre Pleine is of a primrose yellow. Jaune Serin is of a bright
      yellow. Fortune's Banksia has double white flowers, much larger than usual
      with the species, and is greatly admired. The Yellow Banksia is of a
      bright yellow, small, and very double. Rosea is of a bright rose, double.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Banksia is frequently used in greenhouses and conservatories as a
      stock for other climbing roses; and, in many cases, answers well.

      <i>Rosa Rubifolia</i>.&mdash;This native rose has been much improved by
      Mr. Feast and others, and now has many varieties, some of which are
      evidently hybrids. The single variety is in itself very attractive;
      blooming in clusters, which last a long time, and exhibit a pleasing
      diversity of shade, since the flowers grow paler as they grow old. For our
      own part, we prefer the parent to most of its more pretending offspring.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of this family are held in great scorn by transatlantic cultivators.
      Perhaps the climate of England is unfavorable to them; perhaps national
      prejudice may color the judgment; or perhaps the fact that a less rigorous
      climate permits the successful cultivation of many fine climbing roses
      which cannot well be grown here may explain the slight esteem with which
      these coarse children of the prairies are regarded. Coarse, without doubt,
      they are, except those into which another element has been infused by
      hybridization, accidental or otherwise: and yet our climate forbids us to
      dispense with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Queen of the Prairies is among those best known and most desirable.
      Individually, its flowers are as void of beauty as a rose can be.
      Sometimes they are precisely like a small cabbage,&mdash;not the rose so
      called, but the vegetable,&mdash;and they are as deficient in fragrance as
      in elegance. Yet we regard this rose as a most valuable possession. It
      will cover a wall, a pillar, a bank, or a dead trunk, with a profusion of
      bloom, gorgeous as a feature of the garden landscape, though unworthy to
      be gathered or critically examined. It is perfectly hardy, and of the
      easiest culture. Those who can make no other rose grow rarely fail with
      this. The Baltimore Belle is a notable exception to every thing we have
      said in disparagement of the Prairie roses. It is evidently a hybrid of
      some tender, ever-blooming variety, apparently one of the Noisettes; and
      derives, from its paternal parent, qualities of delicacy and beauty which
      are not conspicuous in the maternal stock. At the same time, it has lost
      some of the robust and hardy character of the unmixed Prairie. In a severe
      New-England winter, its younger shoots are often killed back. It shows a
      tendency to bloom in the autumn; and a trifle more of the Noisette blood
      infused into it would, no doubt, make it a true autumnal rose. Some
      florists use it for spring forcing in the greenhouse; for which the
      delicacy of its clustering white flowers, shaded with a soft, flesh-color,
      well fits it. When the worthy Rivers, patriarch of English rose-growers,
      pronounced sentence, ex cathedra, against the whole race of Prairies,&mdash;"I
      will dismiss them with the remark, that none of them are worth
      cultivating,"&mdash;he included in his decree of excommunication one of
      the prettiest climbing roses in existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Maria has very double flowers of pink and rose. Linnæan Hill Beauty
      bears white and pale blush flowers. Miss Gunnell is pale pink, with a
      tinge of buff. It is one of the best, though not equal to the Baltimore
      Belle. Mrs. Hovey has large white flowers; President, deep pink;
      Triumphant, deep rose; Superba, light pink. Among other sorts are the King
      of the Prairie, Eva Corinne, Jane, and Seraphim, all excellent for general
      effect, but not to be classed with the roses suitable for the bouquet or
      the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Prairie roses might, no doubt, be greatly improved by hybridizing.
      Thus, by fertilization with the pollen of the Musk Rose, we should
      probably obtain an offspring with some of the delicacy and fragrance of
      that species. Again: by applying the pollen of some vigorous, hardy rose
      of deep and vivid color, we should improve the color of the Prairie
      without impairing its hardiness. Hybrid China Paul Ricaut would probably
      answer well for this experiment. The Baltimore Belle bears seed
      occasionally; but is so uncertain and capricious in this respect, that it
      will require no little perseverance in the hybridist.

      CHAPTER VII. AUTUMNAL ROSES
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE ROSES of which
      we have hitherto spoken have but one period of bloom in the year. June is
      gay with their flowers; but at midsummer their glory is departed, not
      again to return till a winter of rest has intervened. Various families of
      roses have, however, the faculty of continuous or repeated blooming. Some
      remain in bloom with little interruption for a long time; while others
      bloom at intervals, after periods of rest. These classes are known, with
      little discrimination, as "Autumnal Roses," "Ever-blooming Roses," or
      "Perpetual Roses." The French have a name for those blooming at intervals,
      which is very appropriate. They call them "Remontant Roses,"&mdash;<i>Rosiers
      Remontants</i>,&mdash;in other words, roses which grow again. This very
      well describes them. They make a growth in spring and early summer, and
      the young wood thus produced bears a crop of flowers. Then the plant rests
      for a while; but soon begins another growth, which, in turn, bears
      flowers, though less abundantly than before. The June, or once blooming
      roses, it is true, make also a first and second growth; but, with them,
      the second growth gives leaves alone. In the true ever-blooming roses, or
      roses that bloom continuously, the growth of young wood capable of bearing
      flowers is going on with little interruption during the whole period when
      the vital powers of the plant are awake. It is to stimulate the production
      of this blooming wood that we prune back the shoots that have already
      bloomed, as soon as the flowers have faded.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the possession of a great variety of roses of repeated or continuous
      bloom that gives to the rose-lovers of our own day their greatest
      advantage over those of former times. Our forefathers had but very few
      autumnal roses. The ancient Romans, it seems, had roses in abundance in
      November and December; but this must have been with the aid of a supreme
      skill in cultivation, as there is no reason to believe that they were in
      possession of those Chinese and Indian species, to which the modern
      florist is indebted, directly or indirectly, for nearly all his autumnal
      flowers. As these species are by far the most important of the
      ever-blooming and <i>remontant</i> families, both in themselves and in the
      numberless progeny of hybrids to whom they have transmitted their
      qualities, we place them first on our list.

      <i>Rosa Indica.&mdash;Rosa Semperflorens.</i>&mdash;We include under the
      head of the Chinese Rose two botanical species, because they are so much
      alike, that, for floral purposes, it is not worth while to separate them,
      and because their respective offspring are often wholly undistinguishable.
      The most marked distinction between the two is the greater depth and
      vividness of the color of Rosa Semperflorens; though, by a singular freak
      of Nature, seedlings perfectly white are said to have been produced from
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      China roses will not endure our winters without very careful protection;
      yet they bloom so constantly and so abundantly, that they are very
      desirable in a garden. In large English pleasure-grounds, they are
      sometimes planted in masses, each of a distinct color. They may also be so
      used here by those who will take the trouble to remove them from the
      ground in the autumn, and place them in a frame for protection. For this
      purpose, a hotbed frame may be used, substantially made of plank. It
      should be placed in a situation where the soil is thoroughly drained
      either by Nature or Art. The roses are to be placed in it close together,
      and overlapping each other, to save room; the roots being well covered
      with soil, and the plants laid in a sloping position. By covering them
      with boards and mats, they will then be safe from every thing but mice.
      The most effectual way to defeat the mischievous designs of these
      pestiferous vermin is to cover, not the roots only, but the entire plants,
      with earth. The covering of boards and mats must be so placed as to
      exclude water from rain and melting snow. Tea roses, of which we shall
      speak under the next head, are, as a class, more tender than the Chinas;
      and, in order to preserve them, the soil in the frame should be dug out to
      the depth of a foot, the roses laid at the bottom, and wholly covered with
      earth somewhat dry. On this earth, after the roses are buried, place a
      covering of dry leaves some six inches deep, and then cover the whole with
      waterproof boards or sashes. The leaves alone, if in sufficient quantity,
      would protect the roses from cold, but, at the same time, afford a
      tempting harborage for mice, which would destroy the plants, unless buried
      out of their reach. Thus treated, the tenderest Tea roses will bear the
      winter with impunity in the coldest parts of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though China roses are not equal in beauty to some of their hybrid
      offspring to be hereafter described, they surpass all other roses for
      pot-culture in the window of the parlor or drawing-room. They are more
      easily managed than Tea roses, and, though less fragrant, are not less
      abundant in bloom. No roses are of easier culture in the greenhouse. The
      varieties of this group are the Bengal roses of the French, and are those
      familiarly known among us as Monthly roses. They were introduced into
      England from the East about the beginning of the last century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Carmin d'Yèeles, or Carmin Superbe, has bright carmine flowers. Cramoisie
      Supérieure has double crimson flowers, and, like the former, is excellent
      for pot-culture. Eugène Beauharnais is large, very double, and of a bright
      amaranth-color, approaching crimson. Fabvier is of crimson scarlet, very
      vivid and striking. President d'Olbeque is of a cherry-red.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the above belong to the Semperflorens species, and are of deep
      colors. The following are varieties of Rosa Indica. Archduke Charles is of
      a bright rose-color, gradually deepening as the flower grows older, till
      it becomes, at times, almost crimson. Cels Multiflora is white, shaded
      with pink, and flowers very freely. Madame Bréon is of a rich rose-color,
      very large, double, and compact in form. Clara Sylvain is pure white.
      Madame Bureau is white, with a faint tinge of straw-color. Mrs. Bosanquet
      may be placed in this division; for, though it is certainly a hybrid, the
      blood of the China Rose predominates in it, and characterizes it. It is of
      a pale, waxy, flesh color, very delicate and beautiful, at the same time
      large and double. Napoléon is of a bright pink, and the Duchess of Kent is
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dwarf roses, called Lawrenceanas, or Fairy roses, are varieties of the
      Chinese. They are very small, many of them not exceeding a foot in height,
      and are used as edging for flower-beds in countries of which the climate
      is not too severe for them. Like all other China roses, they are very
      easily grown in pots.
    </p>
    <p>
      "China roses are better adapted than almost any other class for forming
      groups of separate colors. Thus, for beds of white roses,&mdash;which, let
      it be remembered, will bloom constantly from June till October,&mdash;Clara
      Sylvain and Madame Bureau are beautiful. The former is the taller grower,
      and should be planted in the centre of the bed. For crimson, take
      Cramoisie Supérieure,&mdash;no other variety approaches this in its
      peculiar richness of color; for scarlet, Fabvier; for red, Prince Charles
      and Carmin Superbe; for deep crimson, Eugene Beauhamais; for blush, Mrs.
      Bosanquet; for a variegated group, changeable as the chameleon, take
      Archduke Charles and Virginie; for rose, Madame Bréon. I picture to myself
      the above on a well-kept lawn, their branches pegged to the ground so as
      to cover the entire surface; and can scarcely imagine any thing more
      chaste and beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      "To succeed in making these roses bear and ripen their seed in England, a
      warm, dry soil and south wall are necessary; or, if the plants can be
      trained to a fined wall, success will be more certain. Eugène Beauharnais,
      fertilized with Fabvier, would probably produce first-rate
      brilliant-colored flowers. Archduke Charles, by removing a few of the
      small central petals, just before their flowers are expanded, and
      fertilizing it with pollen from Fabvier or Henry the Fifth, would give
      seed; and as the object ought to be, in this family, to have large flowers
      with brilliant colors, and plants of hardy, robust habits, no better union
      can be formed. China roses, if blooming in an airy greenhouse, will often
      produce fine seed: by fertilizing their flowers, it may probably be
      insured. In addition, therefore, to those planted against a wall, some
      strong plants of the above varieties should be planted in the
      orchard-house,&mdash;the place, above all others, adapted for seed-bearing
      roses."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.

      <i>Rosa Indica Odorata</i>.&mdash;This is a Chinese species, closely
      allied to the last named, but more beautiful, far more fragrant, and
      usually more tender. The two original varieties of it, the Blush Tea and
      the Yellow Tea, were introduced into England early in the "present
      century; and between them they have produced a numerous family, than which
      no roses are more beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      To grow them in the open air, they require,'in the first place, a very
      thorough drainage. If the situation is at all damp, the bed should be
      raised some six inches above the surrounding surface; but this will be
      rarely necessary in our climate. If it rests on a good natural stratum of
      gravel, this will be drainage sufficient; but, if not, the whole bed
      should be excavated, and underlaid to the depth of four or five inches
      with broken stones, broken bricks, or with what is much better than
      either,&mdash;oyster-shells. Over these, sift coarse gravel to prevent the
      soil from working into their crevices, and on the gravel make a bed
      somewhat more than a foot deep of good loam, mixed with a nearly equal
      quantity of light, well-rotted manure, adding sand if the texture of the
      loam requires it. The bed should be in an open, sunny situation, and
      sheltered, as far as may be, from strong winds. The Tea roses planted in
      it&mdash;unless they have been exhausted by forcing in the greenhouse&mdash;will
      give a liberal supply of bloom until checked by the autumn frosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of these roses can be grown to great advantage in a cold grapery, in
      a bed suitably prepared. They differ greatly in hardiness, and in respect
      to ease of culture. Some are so vigorous as to form greenhouse climbers,
      and so hardy as to bear a Northern winter by being simply laid down, and
      covered with earth, like a raspberry. Of these is Gloire de Dijon, a rose
      of most vigorous growth, and closely resembling in the shape of its
      blossoms that matchless Bourbon Rose, the well-known Souvenir de la
      Malmaison. Its color, however, is very different, being a mixture of buff
      and salmon. It has one defect,&mdash;a crumpled appearance of the central
      leaves, which gives them a somewhat withered look, even when just open.
      Five or six large plants of this variety are growing here with the utmost
      luxuriance on the rafters of a glass house, without fire. In winter they
      are protected by meadow-hay thrust between them and the glass, and have
      never been injured by the frost.

      For preserving a small number of Tea roses through the winter, an ordinary
      cellar answers perfectly, provided there is no furnace in it. They may
      either be potted or "heeled" in earth in a box. A few degrees of frost
      will not hurt them. Roses and all other plants will bear the same degree
      of cold much better in a close, still air than in the open sunlight and
      wind.

      The prevailing colors of Tea roses are light and delicate: of the
      rose-colored varieties, Adam is one of the finest, as is also Souvenir
      d'un Ami. Moiret is of a pale yellow, shaded with fawn and rose. Bougere
      is of a deep rosy bronze, large and double. Silène resembles it in color,
      and is very much admired. Canary is of the color which its name indicates,
      and its buds are extremely beautiful. Yet, in this respect, no variety can
      exceed the Old Yellow Tea, which is, however, one of the most tender and
      difficult of culture in the whole group. Devoniensis is very large,
      double, and of a pale clear yellow; a very fine rose, but shy of bloom.
      Gloire de Dijon, already mentioned, is a superb rose, though somewhat
      wanting in that grace and delicacy, which, in general, characterize this
      class. Madame Bravy is of a creamy white, and very beautifully formed.
      Madame Damaizin is salmon, and very free in bloom. Madame William is of a
      bright yellow, large, and very double. Niphetos is of a pale lemon,
      turning to snow-white. Safeano is one of the most distinct and remarkable
      roses in the group. It is of a buff and apricot hue, altogether peculiar.
      Its buds are beautifully formed; as are also its half-opened flowers,
      though they are not very double. It is a very profuse bloomer, easy of
      culture, free of growth, and hardy as compared with most other Tea roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      "With attention, some very beautiful roses of this family may be
      originated from seed; but the plants must be trained against a south wall,
      in a warm, dry soil, or grown in pots, under glass. A warm greenhouse or
      the orchard-house will be most proper for them, so that they bloom in May,
      as their hips are a long time ripening.
    </p>
    <p>
      "For yellow roses, Vicomtesse Decazes may be planted with and fertilized
      by Canary, which abounds in pollen: some fine roses, almost to a
      certainty, must be raised from seed produced by such a union. For the sake
      of curiosity, a few flowers of the latter might be fertilized with the
      Double Yellow Brier, or Rosa Harrison. The Old Yellow Tea Rose bears seed
      abundantly; but it has been found from repeated experiments that a good or
      even a mediocre rose is seldom or never produced from it: but, fertilized
      with the Yellow Brier, something original may be realized. Souvenir d'un
      Ami and Adam would produce seed of fine quality, from which large and
      bright rose-colored varieties might be expected; Niphetos would give pure
      white Tea roses; and Gloire de Dijon, fertilized with Safrano, would
      probably originate first-rate fawn-colored roses: but the central petals
      of the latter should be carefully removed with tweezers or pliers, as its
      flowers are too double for it to be a certain seed-bearer."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.

      <i>Rosa Moschata</i>.&mdash;This rose is a native of Asia, Northern
      Africa, and adjacent islands. In Persia it is said to reach a prodigious
      size, resembling some gorgeous flowering tree. It is said, too, that it is
      the favorite rose of the Persian poets, who celebrated its loves with the
      nightingale in strains echoed by their English imitators. Being very
      vigorous, it is best grown as a climber; but, with us, it requires the
      shelter of glass. It flowers in large clusters late in summer, and in a
      warm, moist air, exhales a faint odor of musk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Double White Musk has yellowish white flowers of moderate size.
      Eponine has pure white flowers, very double. The New Double White, or
      Ranunculus Musk, is an improvement on the Double White, which it much
      resembles. Nivea, or the Snowy Musk, can hardly be said to belong to the
      group, as it blooms only once in the year. Ophir, Princess of Nassau, and
      Rivers, are also good examples of this family.

      <i>Rosa Moschata Hybrida.</i>&mdash;Having treated of the China, Tea, and
      Musk roses, we now come to the hybrid offspring which they have jointly
      produced. In 1817, M. Noisette, a French florist at Charleston, S.C.,
      raised a seedling from the Musk Rose, impregnated with the pollen of the'
      common China Rose. The seedling was different from either parent, but had
      the vigorous growth of the Musk Rose, together with its property of
      blooming in clusters, and a slight trace of its peculiar fragrance. This
      was the original Noisette Rose, and it has been the parent of a numerous
      family; but as it has, in turn, been fertilized with the pollen of the
      Tea, and perhaps of other roses, many of its descendants have lost its
      peculiar characteristics, so that in some cases they cannot be
      distinguished from Tea roses. It is thus that confusion is constantly
      arising in all the families of the rose; the groups becoming merged in
      each other by insensible gradations, so that it is impossible to fix any
      clear line of demarcation between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The distinctive characteristic of the true Noisette is blooming in
      clusters. Different varieties have different habits of growth, some being
      much more vigorous than others; but the greater part are true climbing
      roses. Those in which the blood of the Musk and China predominate are
      comparatively hardy. Many of them can be grown as bushes in the open air,
      with very little winter protection, even in the latitude of Boston. Two
      varieties&mdash;Madame Massot and Caroline Marniesse&mdash;are today (Oct.
      16) in full bloom here, where they have stood for several years, with very
      little precaution to shelter them. Some other varieties, again, strongly
      impregnated with the Tea Rose, are quite as tender as Tea roses of the
      pure race.
    </p>
    <p>
      As rafter-roses in the greenhouse, the Noisettes are unsurpassed.

      Aimée Vibert is one of the prettiest of the group. It was raised by the
      French cultivator Vibert, who named it after his daughter. The flowers are
      pure white, and grow in large clusters. Though not among the most vigorous
      in growth of the Noisettes, this variety is comparatively hardy, and in
      all respects very desirable. Miss Glegg resembles her French sister, but
      is scarcely so graceful or elegant. Joan of Arc is a pure white rose,
      growing very vigorously. Madame Massot, sometimes sold by American
      nursery-men under the name of Mademoiselle Henriette, bears large clusters
      of small flowers of a waxy white, faintly tinged with flesh-color. It is
      one of the hardiest of the group. Caroline Marniesse somewhat resembles
      it, but is not equal in beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the above have very distinctly the Noisette characteristics, as
      inherited from their parent, the Musk Rose. Those which follow have been
      hybridized to such a degree with the Tea Rose, that its traits
      predominate; and though, in some of them, the cluster-blooming habit of
      the Musk is not lost, the flowers bear, in size, shape, color, and
      fragrance, a marked resemblance to the Tea. Chroma-tella, or the Cloth of
      Gold, is, when in perfection, the most beautiful of all the yellow roses;
      but it is shy of bloom, and difficult of culture. Solfaterre is also a
      fine yellow rose, much more easily managed than the last. The same may be
      said of Augusta, a seedling raised from it in this country. Isabella Gray
      was also raised in America, and is a seedling from the Cloth of Gold,
      which it rivals in beauty; though, like its parent, it is somewhat
      difficult to manage. Jaune Desprez, or Desprez's Yellow, is of a
      sulphur-color tinged with red, very large and fragrant. America is also a
      large and fine flower of a creamy white; but perhaps the best known of the
      whole group is Lam arque, in New England the greatest favorite among
      greenhouse climbers. Its flowers are of a sulphur-yellow, large and
      double; and its growth is very vigorous.
    </p>
    <p>
      "But few of the Noisette roses will bear seed in this country: the
      following, however, if planted against a south wall, and carefully
      fertilized, would probably produce some. The object here should be to
      obtain dark crimson varieties with large flowers; and for this purpose
      Fellenberg should be fertilized with Octavie, Solfaterre with the Tea
      Rose. Vicomtesse Decazes would probably give yellow varieties; and, these
      would be large and fragrant, as in Lamarque and Jaune Desprez. In these
      directions for procuring seed from roses by fertilizing, I have confined
      myself to such varieties as are almost sure to produce it; but much must
      be left to the amateur, as many roses may be made fertile by removing
      their central petals, and consequently some varieties that I have not
      noticed may be made productive."&mdash;<i>Rivers</i>.

      <i>Rosa Damascena</i>.&mdash;This is a race of Damask roses endowed with
      the faculty of blooming in the autumn. The old roses known as the Monthly
      (not the China roses so called) and the Four Seasons are the parents of
      the group, though not without some infusion of foreign blood. The Damask
      Perpetuals are hardy, and remarkable for fragrance. They demand rich
      culture, even more than most other roses; and the best of them with
      neglect and low diet will bloom but once in the year, and that
      indifferently. On the other hand, they repay generous treatment liberally,
      as some of them are as beautiful as they are fragrant. American
      nursery-men usually catalogue them among the Hybrid Perpetuals, where they
      are out of place; since the true Damask Perpetual is not, in any sense, a
      hybrid, though, as before mentioned, some foreign blood has found its way
      into the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French rose-grower Vibert has formed a new group, which he calls the
      Rose de Trianon, out of the Damask Perpetuals; but, as the subdivision
      seems unnecessary and perplexing, we shall re-annex it to the parent
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are good examples of these Perpetuals: Joasine Hanet has
      deep purplish-red flowers, very showy. Sydonie bears large flowers of a
      rose or bright salmon, and blooms profusely. Yolande of Aragon has
      deep-pink flowers, and is an abundant autumn bloomer. The above belong to
      Vibert's new division. The following are unquestioned Damask: Crimson, or
      Rose du Roi, is of a bright crimson, very large, very fragrant, and an
      excellent autumn bloomer. There is a history attached to it. Count Lelieur
      was superintendent of the royal gardens of St. Cloud, where this rose was
      raised from seed, a little before the restoration of the Bourbons. He
      named it Rose Lelieur, after himself. When Louis the Eighteenth came to
      the throne, an officer of his household insisted that the new rose should
      be named after him. Count Lelieur resisted. A debate ensued. The party of
      the courtiers prevailed: the new rose was called the King's Rose, Rose du
      Roi; and the count resigned his post in disgust. Mogador is a seedling
      from this rose, and is, perhaps, an improvement on it. Portland Blanche is
      pure white, and blooms well in autumn. An English writer sets it down as
      worthless: whence I infer that there must be two of the same name; for
      here it lias proved itself one of the most beautiful of white roses.
      Bernard is a small but very beautiful rose, of a clear salmon-color, and
      is said to be a sport from the Crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As the culture of this class of roses," says Rivers, "is at present but
      imperfectly understood, I shall give the result of my experience as to
      their cultivation, with suggestions to be acted upon according to
      circumstances. One peculiar feature they nearly all possess,&mdash;a
      reluctance to root when layered: consequently, Perpetual Damask roses, on
      their own roots, will always be scarce. When it is possible to procure
      them, they will be found to flourish much better on dry, poor soils than
      when budded, as at present. These roses require a superabundant quantity
      of food: it is therefore perfectly ridiculous to plant them on dry lawns,
      to suffer the grass to grow close up to their stems, and not to give them
      a particle of manure for years. Under these circumstances, the best
      varieties, even the Rose du Roi, will scarcely ever give a second series
      of flowers. To remedy the inimical nature of dry soils to this class of
      roses, an annual application of manure on the surface of the soil is quite
      necessary. The ground must not be dug, but lightly pricked over with a
      fork in November; after which some manure must be laid on, about two or
      three inches in depth, which ought not to be disturbed, except to clean
      with the hoe and rake, till the following autumn. This, in some
      situations, in the spring months, will be unsightly: in such cases, cover
      with some nice green moss, as directed in the culture of Hybrid China
      roses. I have said that this treatment is applicable to dry, poor soils:
      but, even in good rose soils, it is almost necessary; for it will give
      such increased vigor, and such a prolongation of the flowering season, as
      amply to repay the labor bestowed. If the soil be prepared as directed,
      they will twice in the year require pruning: in November [in March, for
      this country] when the beds are dressed; and again in the beginning of
      June. In the November pruning, cut off from every shoot of the preceding
      summer's growth about two-thirds its length: if they are crowded, remove
      some of them entirely. If this autumnal pruning is attended to, there will
      be, early in June the following summer, a vast number of luxuriant shoots,
      each crowned with a cluster of buds. Now, as June roses are always
      abundant, a little sacrifice must be made to insure a fine autumnal bloom:
      therefore leave only half the number of shoots to bring forth their summer
      flowers; the remainder shorten to about half their length. Each shortened
      branch will soon put forth buds; and in August and September the plants
      will again be covered with flowers. In cultivating Perpetual roses of all
      classes, the faded flowers ought immediately to be removed; for in autumn
      the petals do not fall off readily, but lose their color, and remain on
      the plant, to the injury of the forthcoming buds. Though I have
      recommended them to be grown on their own roots, in dry soils, yet, on
      account of the autumnal rains dashing the dirt upon their flowers when
      close to the ground, wherever it is possible to make budded roses grow,
      they ought to be preferred; for, on stems from one to two feet in height,
      the flowers will not be soiled: they are also brought near to the eye, and
      the plant forms a neat and pretty object."

      <i>Rosa Hybrida Bourboniensis</i>.&mdash;The China Rose and one of the old
      Damask Perpetuals, known as the Red Four Seasons, have produced between
      them a distinct family of hybrids known as the Bourbon roses. They are so
      called because they were originated on the Isle of Bourbon. One M.
      Perichon, an inhabitant of that island, in planting a quantity of seedling
      roses raised for a hedge, found one very different from the rest, and
      planted it apart. On flowering, it proved to be distinct from any rose
      before known. Soon after, in the year 1817, a French botanist, M. Bréon,
      arriving at the Isle of Bourbon as curator of the government botanical
      garden established there, investigated the case of this remarkable
      seedling, and became convinced that it was produced between the two
      species named above; since these were then the only roses on the island,
      and both were freely used as hedges. M. Bréon sent plants and seeds of the
      new rose to Paris; and from these have sprung the whole race of the
      Bourbons,&mdash;a race of sweeter savor in horticulture than in history.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are remarkable as a family for clearness and brightness of color,
      perfection of form, and freedom of autumnal blooming. Some of them are
      quite hardy; others are not so in New England. Their growth is various;
      some climbing vigorously if trained to do so, and others forming compact
      bushes. Abundance of manure, a deep and well-dug soil, and mulching with
      newly-cut grass or some similar substance to keep them moist in dry
      weather, joined to judicious pruning, are needed to bring forth their
      beauties in perfection. The stronger growers cannot be pruned severely
      without greatly diminishing the quantity of their bloom; but the ends of
      tall, strong shoots of the same season's growth may be cut off with great
      advantage, thus checking their growth, and causing them to throw out small
      blooming side-shoots.
    </p>
    <p>
      No roses are better than these where the object is to produce a late
      autumnal bloom. They may be made to bloom into the winter by pinching off
      their summer flower-buds, in order that they may not exhaust themselves in
      that season, and by sheltering them from the frost. For forcing, they are
      unsurpassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the most vigorous varieties would make gorgeous pillar-roses,
      provided pains were taken to lay them flat, and cover them with earth
      every winter. Without protection, they would suffer severely in the
      Northern States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acidalie was, till recently, the only white Bourbon; yet it is not pure
      white, but has a tinge of blush. Of late, another white Bourbon has been
      added,&mdash;Blanche Lafitte,&mdash;which is also faintly tinged with
      flesh-color. Adelaide Bougère is of a rich velvety purple. Du-petit
      Thouars is of a vivid crimson, large and double. George Peabody is of a
      purplish-crimson. Louise Odier is a rose of very vigorous growth, and one
      of the hardier members of the family: its flowers are of a bright
      rose-color, of a beautiful cupped form; and it has a tendency to bloom in
      clusters. Prince Albert is still hardier. Its color is a brilliant
      crimson-scarlet, and its autumn bloom is abundant. Sir Joseph Paxton is of
      a bright rose-color, tinged with crimson: its growth is exceedingly
      vigorous; and, with moderate protection, it will bear our winters.
      Souvenir de la Malmaison is unsurpassed among roses. It is very large, and
      beautifully formed. It is of a light, transparent flesh-color; and no rose
      is more admired in a greenhouse. It will also thrive in the open air, and,
      when the soil is well drained, may safely be trusted to bear a New-England
      winter, provided it is covered with earth. In a wet soil, it is usually
      killed. Vorace is of a dark purplish-crimson, and, like the last named,
      only partially hardy. Hermosa, or Armosa, resembles a China rose in the
      character and abundance of its bloom. None surpasses it for forcing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above will serve as favorable examples of the best types of this
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I hope in a few years to see Bourbon roses in every garden; for 'the
      Queen of Flowers' boasts no member of her court more beautiful. Their
      fragrance also is delicate and pleasing, more particularly in the autumn.
      They ought to occupy a distinguished place in the autumnal rose-garden, in
      clumps or beds, as standards and as pillars. In any and in all situations,
      they must and will please. To insure a very late autumnal bloom, a
      collection of dwarf standards, i. e. stems one to two feet in height,
      should be potted in large pots, and, during summer, watered with
      manure-water, and some manure kept on the surface. Towards the end of
      September or the middle of October, if the weather be wet, they may be
      placed under glass. They will bloom in fine perfection even as late as
      November....
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is difficult to point out roses of this family that bear seed freely,
      except the Common Bourbon; but Acidalie, planted against a south wall,
      would probably give some seed. * If any pollen can be found, it might be
      fertilized with the flowers of Julie de Loynes. A pure white and true
      Bourbon Rose ought to be the object: therefore it should not be hybridized
      with any other species. Bouquet de Flore may be planted against a south
      wall with Menoux, with which it should be carefully fertilized: some
      interesting varieties may be expected from seed thus produced. Queen of
      the Bourbons, planted with the yellow China Rose, might possibly give some
      seeds; but those would not produce true Bourbon roses, as the former is a
      hybrid, partaking of the qualities of the Tea-scented roses. Anne Beluze,
      planted with Madame Nerard, would give seed from which some very delicate
      Blush roses might be raised; and Le Florifère, fertilized with the Common
      Bourbon, would also probably produce seed worthy of attention."&mdash;Rivers.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * In America, several varieties bear seed well. Sir Joseph
     Paxton rarely fails, and is a very good subject for
     experiment. The varieties named above by Mr. Rivers are not,
     for the most part, of the first merit.

      We reach, at length, the vast family of the Hybrid Perpetuals,&mdash;a
      race of brilliant parvenus, which, within the last twenty-five years, have
      risen to throw other roses into the shade. As we look upon them, we survey
      a gorgeous chaos. Here are innumerable varieties of foliage and flower,
      perplexing us in our search for genealogies and relationships. All of
      them, however, have, as a basis, some hardy, once-blooming rose, with
      which has been mingled the blood of one, and often of many, of the
      ever-blooming roses, in sufficient proportion to impart some of their
      qualities of autumnal flowering. Many of the Hybrid Perpetuals have, as
      their basis, the Hybrid China Rose, already described under the head of
      the summer roses. This, as we have seen, blooms but once; but when crossed
      with the China, Tea, Bourbon, Damask Perpetual, or several of these
      combined, it becomes capable of blooming in the autumn, without losing its
      hardiness. Such, then, is the origin of this group; and the diversity of
      its characteristics answers to the diversity of its parentage. Thus two
      roses can scarcely be more unlike than Baronne Prévost and the Giant of
      Battles, or La Reine and Arthur de San sal. In Baronne Prévost and La
      Reine, the hardier and more vigorous elements prevail; and they probably
      owe their ever-blooming qualities to an infusion of the Damask Perpetual,
      rather than of the more tender China roses. In the Giant of Battles and
      Arthur de Sansal, on the contrary, the China and Bourbon clements are very
      apparent; and, while these roses are excellent autumn bloomers, they are
      much less hardy and vigorous than the other two.
    </p>
    <p>
      M. Laffay, in his garden at Bellevue, a few miles from Paris, may be said
      to have laid the foundations of the Hybrid Perpetual family. Indeed, to a
      great extent, he created it; having originated a great number of beautiful
      roses, some of which none of the more recent productions have been able in
      the least degree to eclipse. Laflay's roses were chiefly of the hardier
      and stronger type, with La Reine, which was produced about the year 1840,
      at their head.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the motley character of the group, the lines that separate it from
      the Bourbon and from some other families cannot be definitely drawn; and
      there are certain varieties which always hold an equivocal position, being
      sometimes placed with one group, and sometimes with another.
    </p>
    <p>
      These Perpetuals differ greatly in the freedom of their autumn blooming;
      some giving a second and third crop of flowers in abundance; while others
      will not bloom at all after midsummer, except under careful and skilful
      treatment. All require rich culture and good pruning. When an abundant
      autumn bloom is required, a portion of the June bloom must be sacrificed
      by cutting back about half the flower-stems to three or four eyes as soon
      as the flower-buds form. When the flowers fade, these also should be cut
      off with the stems that bear them, in a similar manner. The formation of
      the seed-vessels, by employing the vitality of the plant, tends greatly to
      diminish its autumn bloom. Give additional manure every year, and keep the
      ground open, and free of weeds. If rank, strong shoots, full of redundant
      sap, form in summer, check their disproportioned growth by cutting off
      their tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the North, these roses are better for a little winter protection, such
      as earthing them up at the base, or thrusting pine-boughs into the soil
      among them. They may with great advantage be taken up as often as once in
      three years, and replanted after two or three shovelfuls of old manure
      have been dug into the soil, which, at the same time, should be forked to
      the greatest possible depth. Indeed, it does them no harm to replant them
      yearly: on the contrary, they, generally bloom the better for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excellent way to preserve them during winter, when they have been taken
      out of the ground, is to bury them, root and branch, in earth. The earth
      for this purpose should not be very moist. The place selected should be
      sheltered and dry; the latter point being of the last importance. The
      roses may be tied in bundles, and the earth thrown over them to the depth
      of six inches or more, in such a manner as to shed the rain and snow; and
      if a few boards are placed over it, in a sloping position, it will be so
      much the better. In this way, all the half-hardy roses, and many of those
      regarded as the most tender, can be safely wintered in the coldest parts
      of New England.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is to the family of Hybrid Perpetuals that the French rose-growers have
      given their chief attention. Hence an enormous multiplication of
      varieties, every year bringing forth a new brood, perplexing us with their
      numbers, and by the clamor with which the merits of each and all are
      proclaimed by their respective originators. Some of these new roses are
      unsurpassed in beauty, and deserve all that can be said of them. Yet
      thoroughly to establish the character of a rose requires several years,&mdash;not
      less than six, according to the eminent French rose-grower, M. Jules
      Margottin: therefore it is impossible to speak with entire confidence of
      these novelties. I shall begin with roses of well-established merit, which
      have been for years in cultivation here. Of the rest, which have had not
      more than a season's trial, mention will be made afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Reine is perhaps entitled to the first mention, as it was one of the
      first in its origin, and has never since lost ground. It varies very much
      in quality with circumstances of soil and cultivation, and in its color is
      surpassed by many other roses. Its very large size when well grown, its
      fine form and perfect hardiness, are its points of merit. It is the mother
      of a numerous progeny, among which Auguste Mie is one of the best, growing
      very vigorously, and bearing flowers equal to those of its parent in
      beauty of form, and superior in delicacy of color. They are of a fine
      rose-color, several shades lighter than that of La Reine. Louise Peyronney
      also, in many respects, surpasses her parent; and is a rose of great
      beauty, though scarcely so vigorous as La Reine. Baronne Prévost is
      another hardy and vigorous rose, of a type wholly different: it grows with
      great vigor, bears the rudest winter, and, both in June and in the
      autumnal months, yields an abundance of large, very double flowers of a
      light rose-color. Pius IX. has the same vigor of constitution, and the
      same abundant bloom: its flowers are of a deep rose, tinged with crimson.
      Dr. Arnold is of a deeper color, approaching to crimson, and is one of the
      best autumn bloomers. Madame Boll is a superb rose, very vigorous, very
      hardy, and very double. L'Enfant du Mt. Carmel somewhat resembles it, but
      grows and blooms more freely: its color is a rosy crimson. Jules Margottin
      has no superior in its way: it is of a clear, rosy-crimson color, and its
      half-opened buds are especially beautiful. Triomphe de l'Exposition is of
      a deep crimson; and Souvenir de la Reine d'Angleterre, of a bright rose:
      both are very vigorous and very effective. General Jacqueminot is of a
      fine crimson, and, though not perfectly double, is, nevertheless, one of
      the most splendid of roses. Its size, under good culture, is immense. It
      is a strong grower and abundant bloomer, and glows like a firebrand among
      the paler hues around it. It is one of the hardier kinds, and is easily
      managed. Its offspring are innumerable. The greater part of the new roses
      of the last year or two own it as a parent, and inherit some of its
      qualities. Of its older progeny, Triomphe des Beaux Arts and the Oriflamme
      de St. Louis may be mentioned with honor. The last, especially, is a very
      brilliant rose. Among other deep-colored roses are Triomphe de Paris,
      Gloire de Santenay, and General Washington; the last a seedling from
      Triomphe de l'Exposition. It is a new rose; but there can be little doubt
      of its merit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps no rose among the Hybrid Perpetuals has been so famous, and so
      much praised, as the Giant of Battles; but we cannot fully echo the
      commendations bestowed upon it. All the roses just named are hardy,
      vigorous, and of easy culture, available to the half-practised amateur as
      well as to the experienced cultivator. But the class of Hybrid Perpetuals
      of which the Giant of Battles is the type, and, to a great extent, the
      parent, requires more skill and precaution for successful culture. They
      are all more or less liable to mildew. "I can do nothing with the Giant,
      because the mildew destroys it," a well-known nursery-man writes me.
      Besides this tendency, it is by no means of the vigorous growth which the
      catalogues of nursery-men commonly ascribe to it. Its flowers, however,
      are very brilliant, and, in a favorable season, are produced in abundance.
      In color, they resemble those of General Jacqueminot. Some of the
      seedlings raised from them are much darker; and among these may be
      mentioned Arthur de Sansal, Cardinal Patrizzi, and the Emperor of Morocco.
      Lord Raglan is one of the very finest flowers of this section; and the
      plant is more vigorous, and less liable to mildew, than the rest of the
      group.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are of the lighter, and more delicate shades: Caroline de
      Sansal is of a clear flesh-color, large, full, and of a vigorous, hardy
      constitution. Madame Vidot is, when in perfection, an exquisite rose, of a
      transparent, waxy, flesh color, and formed like a camellia: it has not
      proved hardy here, and has suffered severely every winter. Queen Victoria
      is of a better constitution: it is white, shaded with pink. William
      Griffiths is an old and excellent rose, of a peculiar light satin
      rose-color: it rarely suffers from the winter. Virginal is pure white. La
      Mere de St. Louis is of a waxy flesh-color, and, though not very full, is
      distinct and beautiful. Madame Rivers is of a very light rose. Comtesse de
      Chabrillant is of a clear pink, and very fine. Madame Knorr is of a
      somewhat deeper shade, and singularly beautiful in bud. Louise Magnan and
      Dr. Henon may, with Virginal, in the absence of better, represent the
      white Hybrid Perpetuals,&mdash;a color in which this class is very
      deficient; while a yellow or buff rose is as yet unknown in it, although
      it is said that such an one has been produced, and will soon be "brought
      out."
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are a selection from the new roses; and, though their merits
      have not as yet been tried by the test of time, there can be very little
      doubt that all of them will prove of the highest merit:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice Bernardin is of a bright vermilion, very large and full. Charles
      Lefebvre is of a bright crimson, purplish at the centre, and seems an
      admirable rose. Mrs. William Paul is of a violet-red, shaded with crimson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Madame Clémence Joigne aux is of a red and lilac color, and grows with
      great vigor. Lord Macaulay is of a rich scarlet-crimson: a bloom of it is
      now before me, cut here, in the open air, on the 22d of October. Sour des
      Anges owes its singular name to the delicacy of its tint,&mdash;a soft
      flesh-color; yet the habit of the plant is vigorous, and it seems of a
      hardy nature. Duc de Rohan is red, shaded with vermilion. Beauty of
      Waltham, an English seedling like Lord Macaulay, is of a bright carmine,
      and blooms profusely. Madame Furtado is very large, fragrant, and double:
      its color is a light rosy-crimson. Le Rhone is of a brilliant and deep
      vermilion. Duc de Cazes is of a purplish crimson, so deep as almost to
      appear black. President Lincoln is cherry-red. Princess of Wales is a
      recent seedling of Mr. William Paul, the English rose-grower; and, though
      I have not yet seen it in flower, it is so highly extolled by an English
      amateur, that I mention it here. It is of a bright crimson, with thick and
      firm petals, and said to be very hardy. Sénateur Vaisse is of a brilliant
      red, and has found numerous admirers. Victor Verdier is carmine, shaded
      with purple, large and showy. Louise Margottin is of a delicate, glossy
      rose-color, beautifully formed; and, though marked of moderate growth on
      foreign catalogues, it has grown with uncommon vigor here. Prince Camille
      de Rohan is of a deep maroon approaching crimson. It is very large and
      full.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above comprise the flowers of most brilliant promise among the recent
      novelties. Many others will be mentioned in the supplementary list.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Hybrid Perpetuals combine merits so numerous and so brilliant, that
      they are rapidly driving out of cultivation many roses once in the highest
      esteem. Indeed, with the exception of Moss roses, and some of the Teas,
      Noisettes, and Bourbons, none seem likely to maintain their ground before
      these gorgeous upstarts, some of which are as robust as they are
      beautiful. Their beauties, however, depend greatly on their culture; and
      this is true of all roses. A rose which, under indifferent treatment, will
      be passed unnoticed, puts on, in the hands of a good cultivator, its robes
      of royalty, and challenges from all beholders the homage due to the Queen
      of Flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, the amateur will do well to make this his golden rule:
      Cultivate none but the best, and cultivate them thoroughly. Thoroughness
      is at the bottom of all horticultural success.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Raising new varieties of this family from seed presents an extensive
      field of interest to the amateur; for we have yet to add to our catalogues
      pure white and yellow and fawn-colored Hybrid Perpetuals: and these, I
      anticipate, will be the reward of those who persevere. Monsieur Laffay, by
      persevering through two or three generations, obtained a mossy Hybrid
      Bourbon rose, and many of the finest varieties described in the foregoing
      pages. This information will, I trust, be an incentive to amateurs in this
      country. To illustrate this, I may here remark, that a yellow Ayrshire
      Rose, now a desideratum, must not be expected from the first trial; but
      probably a climbing rose, tinged with yellow or buff, may be the fruit of
      the first crossing. This variety must again be crossed with a yellow rose:
      the second generation will, perhaps, be nearer the end wished for. Again:
      the amateur must bring perseverance and skill into action; and then, if in
      the third generation a bright yellow climbing rose be obtained, its
      possession will amply repay the labor bestowed. But these light gardening
      operations are not labor: they are a delightful amusement to a refined
      mind, and lead it to reflect on the wonderful infinities of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Madame Laffay is an excellent seed-bearing rose: this may be fertilized
      with the Bourbon Gloire de Rosomènes and with Comte Bobrinsky. Dr. Marx
      may be crossed with the Bourbon Paul Joseph and with the Bourbon Le
      Grenadier. These should all be planted against a south wall, so that their
      flowers expand at the same time; and they will probably give some fine
      autumnal roses, brilliant in color, and very double. For fawn-colored, or
      yellowish and white roses, Duchess of Sutherland may be fertilized with
      the Tea-scented roses Victoria and Safrano. These must all have a south
      wall. These hints may possibly be considered meagre and incomplete; but I
      trust it will be seen how much depends upon the enterprise and taste of
      the cultivator."&mdash;<i>Rivers.</i>

      <i>Rosa Bracteata</i>.&mdash;The original species was brought to England
      from China by Lord Macartney in 1795. The varieties are few, and very
      distinct in appearance from other roses. The leaves are small, and of a
      deep shining green. This rose is not hardy, even in England; at least, the
      old varieties of it are not so: but one has lately been sent me, under the
      formidable appellation of Rosa Bracteata Alba Venusta, which is reported
      to have proved hardy in New Jersey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Macartney roses are of a climbing habit, and evergreen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alba Odorata is white, with a yellow centre. The flowers are double. Alba
      Simplex is a single white. Maria Leonida is white, with a blush centre,
      and is the best of the group. There is a hybrid rose raised by M. Hardy,
      of the Luxembourg Garden, and known by the name of Berberifolia Hardi.
      From its resemblance to this division, it is commonly placed with it,
      though not properly belonging here. It is a pretty rose, with bright
      yellow flowers, marked with a chocolate spot in the centre; but it is not
      hardy, nor is it easy of culture.

      <i>Rosa Roevigata</i>.&mdash;No foreign work on the Rose includes this
      species among those held worthy of culture; yet in our Southern States,
      where it is naturalized, it is singularly beautiful. In the North it is
      not hardy, though the root commonly survives the winter, while the stem
      and branches are destroyed. It comes originally from China. Its shoots and
      leaves resemble those of the Banksia Rose; the former being long,
      pendulous, and graceful, and the latter of the most vivid green. Its
      flowers are single, very large, and of the purest waxy white, in the midst
      of which appears the bright yellow of the clustering stamens. Its long,
      slender, tapering buds are unsurpassed in beauty. It thrives admirably in
      a cool greenhouse, climbing with a rampant growth over the rafters, and
      giving forth a profusion of flowers through the greater part of the
      winter. Unlike all the other roses described in this book, it is a species
      in its original, undeveloped state, and, as such, offers a tempting
      subject for the art of the hybridist.

      <i>Rosa Microphylla</i>.&mdash;This is an introduction within the present
      century from the Himalaya Mountains, and is rather a curiosity than an
      ornament. The leaves are very small and very numerous; and, by a curious
      freak of Nature, all the spines seem gathered together on the calyx, or
      outer covering of the flower-buds. The original variety, Microphylla
      Rubra, is perhaps the best. Among others may be named Carnea, Coccinea,
      Rosea, and Purpurea.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a rose, commonly sold under the name of Microphylla Rugosa, which
      is very desirable from the abundance of its autumnal bloom, and from its
      hardy nature; a point in which it differs from the true Microphyllas. It
      grows vigorously, and in autumn blooms profusely in large clusters of
      purplish-red flowers.

      <i>Rosa Centifolia</i>.&mdash;This is a group of Moss roses to which, by
      hybridization, has been communicated some of the character of the
      autumn-blooming roses. The power of repeated blooming has, however, in
      some cases, been acquired at the expense of the distinctive characteristic
      of the Moss Rose; and few of this group are so well mossed as the parent
      to which they owe their name. One of the best is Salet, which is of a
      bright rose-color, tolerably well mossed, a vigorous grower, and an
      excellent autumn bloomer. Madame Edouard Ory is of a somewhat brighter
      hue, but by no means equal in vigor. The Perpetual White Moss is better
      deserving of the name of Moss than either of the others. It is double,
      blooms in clusters, and grows vigorously. Besides these, there are many
      other varieties, most of them indifferent.
    </p>
    <p>
      These roses require the same culture with the Hybrid Perpetuals. Their
      power of autumnal blooming is increased by high enrichment and frequent
      transplanting.

      except Stan-well, which is of a blush color, double, prettily cupped, and

      Here closes our list of Autumnal roses, and with it our book. In
      conclusion, we would remind the cultivator, that although, even under
      neglect and scorn, the Rose has smiles for all, it is only to a loving and
      constant suitor that she clothes herself in all her beauty. Among all the
      flowers of our gardens, none is more grateful for a careful attention, and
      none more abundantly rewards it.

      NEW ROSES OF 1866
    </h2>
    <p>
      The following are the most promising of the latest new roses. The
      descriptions are those of the raisers; and as the varieties have not yet
      bloomed in this country, and very few of them in England, it is impossible
      to speak of them definitely. Most of them are results of the skill and
      perseverance of French cultivators.
